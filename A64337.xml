            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE late Author of This <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> having ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himſelf to the World, when Living, by his indefatigable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in his Prieſtly Function, and by the Works he has already Printed; there will need the leſs to be ſaid in behalf of this Poſthumous piece. For whoſoever had the happineſs of being acquainted with the Author, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be apt to think, that nothing that is mean or unworthy of the Publick, could proceed from a perſon of that True Worth and accompliſh'd Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; one whoſe excellent knowledge in all Church-Controverſies rendered him fit to write of any: and the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoſe Judgment, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
<pb facs="tcp:49823:3"/>of whoſe Life were ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations to all that throughly knew him, That he would Write of none, but what were moſt uſeful to the producing in the Minds of others a true love to Virtue, and a firm adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Truth. And altho' his long continuance in the Countrey, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſidence at his Living, where he had not ſuch frequent opportunities of converſing with the Learned in his own Profeſſion, may give occaſion to ſome to think, that his Parts and Genius muſt ſlag proportionably, and his Writings be tinctured with the rudeneſs of a Country Abode; and by conſequence render him the leſs able to pleaſe and gratifie the humours of this nice and critical Age: yet, I hope, whoever will impartially conſider and read over this ſmall <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> will be abundantly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the contrary. As a proof of which, I appeal to the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> it ſelf; where, if the Judgment of Men of known Abilities may be truſted, there is ſolid Learning ſhewn without any vain Oſtentation of it; Truth vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a native Simplicity that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes it; and the Religious Duties of
<pb facs="tcp:49823:3"/>Chriſtianity preſs'd with that Zeal and warmth, that ſo adorned the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, and rendered the Author whileſt living, the Joy and Admiration of his whole Flock. Nor had the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it been thus long deferred (it being compoſed long before the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's death) but that the native and uncommon kind of Modeſty, which gave a Luſtre to all his Actions, would not permit it in his Life time to ſee the light. He, tho' fraught with ſo much admirable Knowledge, ſtrength of Parts, and ſolidity of Judgment in the opinion of all others; yet always was ſo diffident of any thing of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, that nothing but the ſtrict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Superiours, or the paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate importunity of his Friends, could force him to appear in Print: So great an eſteem had he of the cenſures of other Men, and ſo little, and low Thoughts of his own Worth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' this is not altogether ſo commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, where there is juſt reaſon to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with, as well as conſcious of, a Man's own true Merit in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (many on this account having deprived the World of many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
<pb facs="tcp:49823:4"/>Books) yet if it be a fault, it is ſuch an one as none but the beſt of Men have been, or can be guilty of; and for which likewiſe their deſerts when made known, have become the more illuſtrious: Humility and Lowlineſs of Mind being Virtues of as great Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as they are rare, and as apt to beget a due eſteem of thoſe, that are endued with them, as Pride and ſelf conceit are to produce hatred and contempt.</p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhould hinder the <hi>Reader</hi> by too long an Epiſtle from the pleaſure and advantage he may reap from the Author himſelf, or ſeem to allure his favour by a too tedious beſpeaking of him; I ſhall wholly ſubmit this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> (it having no other Patron) to his unbyaſſed Judgment; and hope, tho' it had not the Author's laſt hand, yet it may meet with ſo kind a reception, as to conduce ſomething to the ſpiritual welfare and happineſs of Mankind. And then I am ſure it will anſwer to all the ends and purpoſes the Pious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor deſigned it, and be ſo far the more probable to ſhew, who its Compoſer was; in that it will be always imployed in doing good.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION 1.</hi> Concerning the Nature of Divine Worſhip.</head>
               <p>HE, who will give himſelf leiſure to ponder the importance of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Veneration, and the innate pronity in men to form incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous Notions of it, and the reſtleſs attempts of the Infernal Spirit to cheriſh this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and keep us from right conceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, will eaſily be induced to juſtifie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Inquiry.</p>
               <p>Religious Worſhip is deſervedly accounted by the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as one of the Pillars which ſupport the World, and prevent its retirement into its primitive Abyſs. It cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that the Arm of Omnipotence, which bears up all Things, ſhould continue to be ſo propitious, where the Homage due to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not paid. It is a provocation of the firſt magnitude to neglect the making our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential acknowledgments to Him, to whom we are indebted for our Exiſtence, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever contributes to our real Felicity. There
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49823:11"/>cannot be a more open affront put upon the indiſpenſable Law of Gratitude. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Bounty of the Supreme Being, it will eaſily inform us, that ſome thankful return is to be made: and to Worſhip and ſolemnly own the infinite Excellency of our Benefactor, is all that we are in capacity to do. No real addition can accrue to boundleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Of this Worſhip, which is ſo important; we are apt to entertain very unſuitable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. A ſenſe of the Deity is deeply rooted in humane Nature: and by reaſon of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural depravation it lies under, there is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal belief of our being obnoxious to Divine Juſtice. This raiſeth fears and jealouſies, and puts the Soul upon deviſing ways, whereby the Supreme Being may be atoned. Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſet upon the Rack, and as many recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling methods thought upon, as there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Humors.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> This is the true fountain of that Superſtition which we often meet with in the Writings of the Heathens. They upon a deliberate view and ſurvey of themſelves, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were not in a temper agreeable to the Idea, which they had of a Sovereign Being, and likewiſe unable to conteſt with his power, which they had reaſon to believe their own delinquencies would not permit to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious unto them: They fell to contrive ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways of Worſhip in order to the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an Atonement. At firſt they Sacrificed Plants, afterwards Beaſts, at laſt Men. The meaneſt creatures, as Apes, Onions, Garlick,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49823:11"/>they courted with Divine Veneration,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de laudibus Conſt. p. <hi>645</hi> Valeſ.</note> fearing otherwiſe they might neglect the giving their due regards to that tranſcendent power which appeared in the formation of them. They dreſſed up their Religion with all the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Art, thinking by their pompous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to reconcile the Deity, and induce him to favour them with a benign Aſpect.</p>
               <p>To this we may add the unceſſant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of our Infernal Adverſary to keep us from right conceptions of Worſhip. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents ſeveral ways, and keeps up the credit of them by blending ſomething with them, which he borrows from the divine Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Correſpondencies betwixt his Worſhip, and ſome rites recorded in the Bible, are evident demonſtrations of this truth.</p>

                  <hi>Res Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum Divinorum in Idolorum myſteriis aemula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Theſe inſtances make it obvious, that there has been in ſome particulars a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude betwixt the Worſhip of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the Rites which have been practiſed in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkneſs. This agreement muſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen either fortuitouſly, or elſe be deſigned by ſome intelligent Being. The firſt cannot be aſſerted with any good reaſon. It is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, how there ſhould be a harmony in ſo many things of a poſitive nature, without the interpoſals of an intellectual Principle. If it was deſigned, then God muſt either intend an imitation of the Worſhip of the Devil, or the Devil the Worſhip of God: to aſſert the firſt is highly incongruous, God forbids his people to enquire into his Worſhip, and learn the ways he had ſeduced the Heathens into.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49823:12"/>It cannot be imagined, that he ſhould teach them that, which he forbids them to learn. The Moſaical Law was enacted with a deſign to obliterate the memory of the Religion of the Idolaters: and therefore we cannot think that he would make any of their injunctions a part of his own. The Records of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> are of a more early date than thoſe which repreſent unto us the Worſhip of the Heathens. And we cannot conceive how the contents of the Ancient Record ſhould be an imitation of what is contained in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern. The Author of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 3.48.</note> that the Heathens ſet up Idols, which have ſome likeneſs to thoſe things which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law. And the Fathers of the Chriſtian Church, generally accord in this, that the <hi>Ethnick</hi> conſtitutions did derive their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this being conſidered, namely, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of Divine Worſhip, our aptitude to be miſtaken about it, the policy of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter to cheriſh our inclinations; it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be our concernment to gain a true Notion of it. In order to this end, the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are to be well weighed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Worſhip in general, imports a reverential and humble acknowledgment of the ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent worth and excellency which is in another. We may honour our inferiours or equals. But properly we Worſhip that only, which is veſted in ſome eminency, which we our ſelves are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of; and therefore the Act always ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49823:13"/>an humble ſubmiſſion in the Mind. This Excellency is not only power and authority, but goodneſs or any other perfection. We ſpeak as congruouſly, when we ſay, We adore the Wiſdom and Benignity of the Supreme Being as his ſovereignty and dominion. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar,</hi> who was in power ſuperiour to <hi>Daniel,</hi> yet worſhipped him upon the account of his ſuperlative underſtanding. Worſhip has ſeveral names according to the diverſity of the acts, whereby the acknowledgment of worth is made: if it be by entertaining a high eſteem of it in the mind, Internal Veneration; if by external acts appropriated by nature or inſtitution to ſignifie this eſteem, as an humble bowing of the Body, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: ſerving and obeying; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Worth which is to be acknowledged is either finite or infinite. Finite, is that which is lodged in a limited Being: it is either Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as in thoſe who are eminent for ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Accompliſhments; or Civil, as in Parents and Magiſtrates. Both theſe challenge from us regards ſuitable to their Nature. The firſt a Moral, the ſecond a Civil Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Infinite worth is that which is found only in the Supreme Being: and our agnitions of it muſt be made by ſuch acts as are congruous to the nature and inſtitution of him, in whom it reſides.</p>
               <p>It is as natural for an intellectual Soul rightly poliſhed, to make this reverential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as for a ſmooth body to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49823:13"/>of the Sun-beams which fall upon it. The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which imports glory, ſignifies likewiſe a weight. The ſuperlative glory of the Divine Nature (when duely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) is to the Soul, what a weight is to the Body: it naturally produceth a ſuccum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency, and works it into a religious proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thoſe who are moſt elevated in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, when they meet with excellency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely tranſcending what they themſelves are poſſeſs'd of, cannot but be ſo juſt as to ſtoop and make their due acknowledgments. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find it controverted in any Nation, whether honorary Addreſſes ought to be made to the Deity. All the Sons of Pride, upon diſcovery of boundleſs perfection, bluſh at the thoughts of competition, and ſtudy by ſubmiſſive appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to make it propitious to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Acts, whereby an Acknowledgment of infinite Excellency is made, are either me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate or immediate. By mediate may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſuch as altho' they do not import an immediate acknowledgment of Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet have an efficacious influence upon the production of thoſe which do. That their nature may be the better diſcerned, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars muſt be conſidered, 1. The World is formed by the infinite power of the Supreme Being. The intellectual part of it increaſing by his benediction, he has made it up into families, families augmenting, he has out of them conſtituted Kingdoms and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. By him Princes rule, and Subjects are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49823:14"/>obliged to give their due regards to them. 2. Whatſoever is of his formation, he hath made with a deſign to manifeſt the glory of his goodneſs and benignity. Every wiſe Agent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds ſome worthy end to himſelf in all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations; and there is no purpoſe, that we know of, more worthy of and congruous to the Divine Nature than this. 3. That which has an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate connexion with the glory of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benignity, is the felicity of thoſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular perſons, families, or kingdoms which are produced by him. The health of the Patient is the glory of the Phyſician. The proſperity of the Community the honour of the Prince. Much more the felicity of the creatures is the glory of him, from whom they received their Beings. 4. The felicity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Families conſiſts in their flouriſhing eſtate, when they are in an enjoyment of all things which the nature of their conſtitution requires: The happineſs of ſolitary perſons in the inward tranquillity of their mind, when there is no mutiny among their faculties, but a tranſcendent contentment, ſpringing from a ſence of being imployed in thoſe operations which are ſutable to the dignity of humane nature. 5. There are many actions, which have a peculiar tendency to promote this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. The flouriſhing ſtate of Nations and Families is advanced, when the deportment of every member is agreeable to the beſt rules of Policy and Oeconomy. When Superiours impoſe juſt commands, Inferiours render a cheerful obedience, and every one moves as an
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49823:14"/>Intelligence in his proper Orb. The inward tranquillity of private perſons, when they bound their deſire of ſublunary gratifications with the rules of Temperance, are not tranſported with the ſmiling aſpects, nor dejected with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt frowns of Fortune; keep an equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per amidſt all thoſe affronts, with which their Contentment is aſſaulted, do not tranſgreſs the juſt bounds of Magnanimity or Meekneſs, ſweeten their converſation towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with gentleneſs and affability, abate the acrimony of Juſtice with mixtures of Equity; encourage beneficence with grateful returns, and are merciful to the objects of compaſſion. The Soul having a ſenſe of a turpitude in ſome actions, and that while ſhe is engaged in theſe, her demeanour is agreeable to the dignity of her nature, and the grand deſign of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: ſhe is eminently delighted with them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd arrives at the very top of moral felicity.</p>
               <p>Theſe actions, accompanied with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influences of Heaven, being exerted, will introduce ſuch a happy temper into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, as will highly conduce to the honour of the Supreme Rector, and excite all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Beings to fall down before him, and make the moſt reverential acknowledgments of his infinite benignity and goodneſs. Upon this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4.

                  </gap> analogy to the thing acknowledged, therefore the object of the acknowledgment being in communicable, the agnition it ſelf ought to be ſo. This appropriation muſt be not only in reſpect of degree, but the ſpecies. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49823:15"/>worth, being not only of a diverſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but of a different ſpecies and kind from that which is finite, there muſt be not only a gradual, but a ſpecifical difference betwixt the Worſhip which is terminated upon both. This makes it conſpicuous, that the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honour, which is one ſpecies of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, cannot with juſtice be given to God and the Creature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Theſe immediate and appropriate acts are either internal or external. By internal I mean the elicit acts of the Soul: By external the imperate acts of the Body. God having a peculiar intereſt both in the Soul and Body, upon the account of his Creation and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of them: We lie under an obligation to make our acknowledgments by ſuch acts as flow from both. External performances are eminently ſerviceable to the grand deſign of Religion. The actions of our bodies conduce to the increaſe of inward devotion. When we preſent them as a living ſacrifice to God, this oblation has the ſame effect upon the mind, which the fat of the Sacrifice had upon the fire of the Altar: it communicates ſtrength to our zeal, and a higher degree of ardency to our affections. It has an influence upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging of others in a ſimilitude of practice. The light of a Religious deportment ſhining before Men, will excite them to pay their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of honour to their Father in Heaven. Their underſtanding being illuminated with ſuch divine raies, like a burning-glaſs, produceth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49823:16"/>an inflammation in the will, and puts all the faculties of the Soul into a due temper and motion. It likewiſe tends to the advancement of the glory of God. We glorifie him when we manifeſt and fet forth his excellency. Corporal Worſhip, which is viſible and obvious to ſence, cannot with juſtice be denied a ſhare in the promoting this work.</p>

Internal Acts are either ſuch as have a general aſpect upon the excellency of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature: or elſe a more ſpecial upon ſome particular Attributes. The univerſal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Deity is acknowledged, when we frame an Idea of his infinite Majeſty as exact, and agreeable to him, as our finite capacity will permit; and in a ſence of it proſtrate our Souls with all humility before him. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of particular Attributes is owned by ſome particular Acts, which are ſutable to their nature. Believing, as it imports an aſſent, is an owning of the veracity of God. When this Aſſent is ſo vigorous and efficacious, as to bow the will into a cordial compliance with the import of that truth which is aſſented to, and engage it in a chearful obedience, it is a confeſſion of divine dominion and authority: <hi>fearing,</hi> if it be mixed with ſervility, is an agnition of punitive juſtice; if ſublimated into filial temper, of paternal goodneſs.

                  </note> and Chriſt is ſaid to offer them up. They are as proper parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as Sacrifices and Oblations were under the Law. Upon this piece of Spiritual Homage an agnition of divine perfection is as conſpicuous, as <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Image upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Penny. When we pray for wiſdom and holineſs, we cannot give a more lively ſignification of our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49823:17"/>acknowledgment; that theſe perfections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in God in a peerleſs degree.</p>
               <p>As Prayer, ſo Praiſes in Hymns and Pſalms is a part of Natural Worſhip. All Nations have expreſſed their eſteem of their Deities in this way. It was in uſe among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as appears by their <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the firſt ſung to the gods or goddeſſes, which they believed did favour them: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to thoſe whom they accounted not to be propitious to them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> the ſame way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip obtained: as is evident by their <hi>Aſſamenta Junonia &amp; Minervia,</hi> Poems compoſed in the Honour of thoſe Deities whoſe names they bear. Amongſt the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as is manifeſt from the poetical compoſitions in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Chriſtians, as is plain from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical exhortation to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians;</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi>'s report to <hi>Trajan</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their practice. Tho' Prayers and Praiſes may be directed to men upon a civil account; yet this doth not hinder them from being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate parts of the Worſhip of God. When we ſay, that they with other actions are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture peculiar to the Deity, we mean not as they are taken materially. So they are of a common nature, like matter conſidered in the abſtract, without any particular form. But we take them formally together with their indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduating circumſtances, which do determine and limit them. We may pray to men, but to do it when they are not preſent, for ſuch things which none but the Supreme being can confer;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49823:18"/>in ſuch an aſſembly as is met ſolely upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious account, would be, by all impartial Expoſitors, interpreted an invading the right of Heaven, and an inexcuſable injury to the Divine Glory.</p>
               <p>To Prayer and Praiſe we may add, the taking an Oath, the making a ſolemn Vow to God, as parts of natural Worſhip. All the Heathens, which had nothing to direct them but the light of Nature, were fully acquainted with them, as appears by clear teſtimonies in their writings, which to mention would be ſuperfluous. They both involve a plain acknowledgment of the perfections of the Divine Nature. He who takes an Oath invocates God to be a witneſs and a revenger: which addreſs includes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Omniſcience, that he is privy to that which is ſecret, and unknown to others: his Veracity, that he takes pleaſure in truth, and has a perfect deteſtation of that which is oppoſite to it: his Power, that he is able to take vengeance, and aſſert the dignity of the Law which is violated.</p>
               <p>He who makes a ſolemn Vow, if it be to engage himſelf to ſome expreſſions of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, doth thereby declare his deep ſence of the Divine Benignity: if to bind himſelf the faſter to a loyal deportment in his converſation, the dominion of Heaven over him.</p>
               <p>If any doubt (notwithſtanding what has been repreſented) whether this part of Worſhip is to continue under the Evangelical diſpenſation, he may ſatisfie himſelf by conſidering, that this is plainly foretold by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, c.</hi> 19.21.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49823:18"/>The taking away of what was given to God by Vow is condemned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. and death was afflicted upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for their miſcarriage in this particular, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.5, 10. The devoting of things to God by Vow is grounded upon reaſon common to all ages; as well the times of the Goſpel as the Law. The whole world is a Community under the regency of one ſupreme Monarch. This Community he has parcell'd out into King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and committed the government of them to his Vicegerents. In every kingdom the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have their properties bounded and limited by Law. Theſe rights they are ſo inveſted in, that they have withal a power of alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The natural ſigns of their will, when they exert this power, are promiſſory words. There is no reaſon why this way of exchange may not as well prevail in the univerſal Community betwixt the Supreme Rector and his Subjects, as in any particular betwixt his Vicegerents, and thoſe who are under their regency. A Vow is nothing but a ſolemn promiſe made unto God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Inſtituted Acts are ſuch as have their foundation in poſitive inſtitution. For the right underſtanding of them, it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the new Covenant, of which our bleſſed Lord is the Mediator, was made by the poſitive pleaſure of the Divine Will. It is the product of free Grace, as is apparent by the caſe of the fallen Angels. They have no over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of reconciliation made to them. Chriſt did not ſhed his blood to quench the fire of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49823:19"/>Hell for them. God having a deſign to publiſh and make known this gracious Covenant, he has made choice of his Word and Sacraments to do it by. The preaching, hearing, reading this Word and receiving the Holy Sacraments may be truly ſtiled acts of inſtituted Worſhip, they become a duty to us by the poſitive inſtitution of the new Covenant, and import an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the benignity and goodneſs of God to mankind.</p>
               <p>Preaching and publiſhing with integrity of heart, the methods of divine Grace in the work of redemption, is an undeniable expreſſion of a ſerious and devout ſence of the benignity of Heaven. Thoſe who preach Chriſt, who is the brightneſs of the divine Glory, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily by the ſame action give Glory and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God. Tho' preaching the Goſpel as it imports teaching, is a religious duty, and looks down upon men only: yet as it ſignifies the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming before men the ineſtimable goodneſs of Heaven, it looks upwards to God, and may challenge a place amongſt the parts of his Worſhip. Upon this account Miniſters are ſaid to be a ſweet favour unto God, whether their Hearers will be ſaved or periſh, admit or refuſe their inſtructions. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the ſacrifice of Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.17. The Faith of the Goſpel is of ſo excellent nature, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial publiſhing of it implies a ſolemn obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Praiſe to him, who is the fountain of it.</p>
               <p>To this part of Worſhip, we may add Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reading, receiving the Sacraments. The Liturgy joyns together the ſetting forth the Praiſe of God, and the hearing his Word; when we with holy reverence hearken to it, we ſet forth the Praiſe of his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, which by our devout and ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, we acknowledge to be ſufficient and ready to inſtruct us.</p>
               <p>He who reads the Scripture as the Word of the living God, with an intention to be made wiſe unto Salvation by it, doth thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his deep ſence of the incomprehenſible and profound underſtanding of the Author of it.</p>
               <p>When Proſelytes are admitted into the Church by Baptiſm, and have the remiſſion of their ſins ſealed unto them, upon the terms of the new Covenant; it is an evident indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their humble reſentments of the infinite goodneſs of God, in granting an act of Amneſty and pardon, after the violation of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Their being baptiſed in the name of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49823:20"/>the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt is an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a reverential acknowledgment of, and an entire devotion to the ſacred and bleſſed Trinity.</p>
               <p>The receiving the Symbols of the body and blood of our Lord, imports a laudatory agni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him. It is not an empty remembrance which is intended, but a ſolemn commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, attended with the moſt emphatical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Praiſe and Gratitude. It is ſtiled a <hi>ſhewing forth,</hi> in alluſion to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>

               <p>Theſe two Sacraments were not deſigned for the primitive times only, but to continue to the laſt period of the World. The reaſon of their continuance is common to all Ages: we have now as much need to renounce our ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy, profeſs our repentance, promote ſanctification, be received into the Church: commemorate the death of Chriſt, renew our covenant, gain a fuller Communion, as they which lived in the firſt age. And it is not now inexpedient, that we ſhould be taught by ſome viſible ſigns, our intellectual powers are in as much dependence upon ſence as formerly. Were the attainments of the preſent Age equal to the ſtate of Paradiſe, this way of inſtruction would not be diſagreeable. <hi>Eden</hi> was not without Two Sacramental Trees.</p>

               <p>Their permanency is likewiſe aſcertained to us by a Divine Revelation. In the Commiſſion to Baptiſe, it is ſaid, I will be with you to the end of the world. To interpret baptiſing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an initiating by Doctrine without Water, and the end of the world, the end of the age in which the Apoſtles lived, is to offer too much violence to the Text.

               <p>When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lord's death till he come:</hi> He evidently declares, that the inſtitution of the Supper is to continue till the laſt appearing of Jeſus Chriſt. There are but four comings of his uſually ſpoken of. The Firſt in the Fleſh, when he aſſumed our nature: the Second in the Spirit to ſanctifie and rule his Church: the Third in his vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative Juſtice to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> the Fourth in the laſt day to Judge the World. The two firſt cannot be underſtood. They were paſt, when the Apoſtle wrote his Epiſtle. The Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias was then come in the Fleſh to all mankind. In the Spirit at the ſolemn feaſt of Pentecoſt, and in particular to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> they were ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus. 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.2. But the coming which the Apoſtle aims at, is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>until I come.</hi> Neither can we underſtand his coming to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> For theſe words are inſerted with a deſign to awake the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to a greater degree of circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their preparations for the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, intimating that it ſhall continue, till Chriſt come to ſummon them before his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and judge them for their unworthy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. There was no ſummons of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> at the overthrow of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore the laſt coming muſt be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Theſe Acts which have been enumerated, ſome in ſavour of the Maſs, would perſwade us; that ſacrificing is to be added as a part of Divine Worſhip under the Goſpel. If this be ſo, it muſt be warranted by ſome Divine Law,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49823:21"/>and this muſt be either natural, or poſitive. Natural it is not, as will be evident by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſiderations. 1. A Sacrifice is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſome material thing unto God, and in the offering deſtroyed. The eſſential difference, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from other Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is the deſtructive mutation. This change cannot reaſonably be eſteemed an act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but ſo far as it is an acknowledgment of ſome excellency appertaining to the Divine Nature as Sovereignty, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In its ſelf, before it has an inſtitution enſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon it, it imports no ſuch agnition. Were we left to the conduct of natural light, it would rather induce us to believe that the Godhead is diſhonoured, than worſhipped by a diſſolution of the creature; in whoſe compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, divine Power and Wiſdom are eminently conſpicuous. 2. If the light of nature leads us to this practice, it muſt be, becauſe it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to the Honour of God; and if ſo, (we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under an obligation to honour him in the ſuperlative and moſt exalted degree) the ſame reaſon will dictate, that mankind the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent part of the viſible Creation, is to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled out for this ſacred purpoſe: Nay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> wanted not the warranty of a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the offering up of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> but was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſtructed by the light of Nature in that concernment.

               <p>
                  <hi>Apollonius Tianeus</hi> aſſerts, that the way to make God propitius to a man, is not to kindle fire, and ſacrifice ſenſible things; but to offer up his mind in Prayer to him. Theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars being put together, it is evident, that the ſacrificing material things, is not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49823:23"/>the Law of Nature. If there be a poſitive inſtitution for it, it muſt be either in the Old or New Teſtament. In the Old I grant it even before the Law was given from mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> This is evident from the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of men. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> in the land of <hi>Eden, Abraham</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan, Job</hi> in the land of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z, Jethro</hi> in the land of <hi>Midian.</hi> If there had been nothing in the caſe but arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary pleaſure, and no ſetled inſtitution even from the Creation: it cannot be conceived how perſons of different tempers, inhabiting at a great diſtance one from another, ſhould come all to conſpire in the ſame practice. And if there was an inſtitution, it could be from none but God.</p>
               <p>The grand deſign of Sacrifices, will contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute a further evidence to this aſſertion. They all from the beginning were types of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, the Lamb of God was ſlain in effigie from the foundation of the World. If the Oblation of Chriſt has its foundation in a divine inſtitution, which all muſt grant, then ſacrifices, which had always an aſpect upon it, muſt have the ſame baſis. He who deſigns the end, appoints the means conducing to it.</p>
               <p>The Faith of the Sacrificers is a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. <hi>Abel</hi> is ſaid by Faith to offer up a more excellent Sacrifice than <hi>Cain, Heb.</hi> 11.4. Faith, in this chapter is mentioned ſeveral times, and is in every place of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Now it is expreſſed that the Faith of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> was founded upon Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the firſt was warned of God, the ſecond called; therefore we have reaſon to conclude
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49823:23"/>the ſame concerning the Faith of <hi>Abel,</hi> when he made his Oblation to the Divine Majeſty. Laſtly, God's acceptance of the Sacrifices then tendred, gives aſſurance, that the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had the warranty of the Divine Will for what they did. The uſual token was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of celeſtial Fire upon the Sacrifice: We never read of any ſuch teſtimony that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of divine complacency in meer arbitrary worſhip: but on the contrary, frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of it. Tho the worſhip at <hi>Tophet,</hi> was highly culpable upon ſeveral accounts, yet they are all omitted, except this one: yet it never came into the heart of God to command it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 5. Tho' all this be granted, it will not follow, that Sacrificing is to be continued under the New Teſtament; but on the contrary, we have a clear repeal of the old Law, as is manifeſt by the following conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Place, to which the offering of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was appropriated, is irrecoverably deſtroyed by the allowance of Heaven, as appears by the predictions of the Prophets, and the words of our bleſſed Saviour. When the <hi>Jews</hi> had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a grant from <hi>Julian</hi> to rebuild it, and ſpared no coſt (their very ſhovels being of ſilver) in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the accompliſhment of their work:<note place="margin">Theod. Hiſt. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi> p. <hi>103.</hi>
                  </note> yet they were not able to perfect it. What they did in the day, was undone by an inviſible hand in the night. Vaſt heaps of materials prepared for building were diſſipated by violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts. They not deſiſting, nowtithſtanding theſe ſignifications of diſpleaſure; at laſt they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49823:24"/>were compelled by an Earthquake, and an eruption of Fire, which conſumed many of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prieſthood, which was ſolely intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the oblation of Sacrifice, is changed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.18. When it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſware and will not repent, thou art a Truſt for ever, after the order of Melchiſedeck, v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> implies he did repent the ſetting up the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that is, do as men uſe to do, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, revoke, and diſannual it. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that a little before the coming of Chriſt, the precious ſtones upon the ſhoulders and pectoral of the Prieſt ceaſed to ſhine. It is certain; that within a little while the glory of the Aaronical Prieſthood was to diſappear, and be ſwallowed up in the brightneſs of the Prieſthood of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And the Prieſthood being changed, that there is made a neceſſity, a change of the Law concerning Sacrifice, which the Prieſt only had power to execute.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The uſe, which Sacrifices were deſigned for, did ceaſe at the death of Chriſt. They were intended as figures of his Sacrifice. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. Now he having offered up himſelf real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Croſs, all thoſe ſhadows are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and become uſeleſs. This is agreeable to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s prediction, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> would cauſe the Sacrifice and oblation to ceaſe, <hi>c.</hi> 9, <hi>v.</hi> 27. and to the Author of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that they were impoſed till the time of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10.<note place="margin">Juſt.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a God who has made the World,</hi> Tho' his Exiſtence is ſuppoſed in a Diſcourſe of Divine Worſhip: yet the Atheiſm of the age, in which we live, makes it neceſſary to ſet it in as clear a light as poſſibly we can; which I will endeavour to do, <hi>Firſt,</hi> by conſidering the World in general, <hi>Secondly,</hi> in its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in General. If there be no God which has given Being to it; then it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in reſpect of Matter and Form: Or elſe the Matter is eternal, and in proceſs of Time did work it ſelf into the preſent Form: or elſe both Matter and Form did emerg and begin in time.</p>
               <p>The World, as it is now in reſpect of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Form with all the changes and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, could not be eternal; for then the ſpringing and decay of Plants, the generation and corruption of Animals, the birth and death of Men, muſt be eternal: and if ſo, then all theſe things were always ſimultaneous; Death as early as Life, Autumn as the Spring, the decay of Plants, as the growth and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of them. There is no inequality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of duration, amongſt thoſe things that are eternal. If this Hypotheſis prevail, the Sun, Moon and Stars can no longer move; for their revolutions that are paſt, are either finite or infinite: finite they cannot be, if they be eternal, for every finite number has a firſt, and every firſt implies a beginning, and that which has a beginning is not eternal: if infinite, then no addition can be made to them. Infinity is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49823:28"/>uncapable of an increaſe. According to this aſſertion it would be a greater wonder that the Sun ſhould perſiſt in his diurnal motion, than that he ſhould ſtand ſtill in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s days. To this we may add, that the moſt authentick Record extant, gives us an account of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World; how it was made and who was the efficient cauſe of it. The credit of the relation did ſo far gain upon the belief of the generality of Mankind; Hiſtorians, Poets, Philoſophers, that it ſeems to be agreed amongſt them, that the World was made out of a rude Chaos, and digeſted by a Divine Hand into that order which is viſible to us. The opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> bears no proportion to what is in the ſcale on the other ſide. If the World was eternal, how came it to paſs, that there is a remembrance but of five or ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſince the beginning, when ſo many millions are paſt? or how Arts and Sciences ſhould not be brought to perfection long before the <hi>Epocha,</hi> that is uſually given to them? If men did eternally exiſt, nothing could have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped their diſcovery by this time. Their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtudies, muſt neceſſarily have conquered all difficulties, and ſet the moſt concealed myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of nature in the cleareſt light.</p>
               <p>If matter be eternal, and in proceſs of time did work it ſelf into its preſent form: this matter muſt be from eternity one entire body, or elſe be divided into ſeveral parts. If one; it cannot be imagined, how it ſhould come to be broken into ſo many fragments, as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the compoſition of the Univerſe. It
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49823:28"/>could not diſſolve it ſelf into particles; for its unity being eternal, muſt be natural; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but violence will make any thing depart from its own nature. If the diſtinct particles were eternal, they muſt be at reſt or in motion. If at reſt, there muſt be ſome eternal cauſe to diſquiet them, before the form of the World could be produced by them. It is natural for matter to perſevere in the ſtate in which it is, till it meet with ſuch an agent. If they were in motion, this motion muſt be regulated by Laws, or elſe be caſual and fortuitous. If by Laws, there muſt be an Intelligent Being to form and impreſs them upon the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and this can be nothing but a God. If caſual and fortuitous, it is not imaginable, (they having no Commander over them) how they ſhould fall into their ſeveral ranks, and produce as beautiful an order, as the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate wiſdom could have contrived. We may with leſs force to our underſtandings conceive, how millions of blind, deaf and dumb men in a vaſt deſert, without any General over them, may fall into a military Order, march in their diſtinct ranks, keep to their proper colours, charge their enemies, fall back without the leaſt confuſion: as, how an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of material Particles ranging in an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſpace, without any intelligence to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their motion, ſhould produce all the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearances with which the Univerſe is adorned. He muſt be exalted in his own fancy, who can perſwade himſelf, how, after all the dances which theſe particles have had from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49823:29"/>eternity, they ſhould at laſt come to embrace and claſp together, ſome in the ſhape of Dogs, ſnarling and barking; ſome in the ſhape of Horſes, neighing and prancing; others in the ſhape of Men, talking and laughing together.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible that the rational Soul which has no matter in it, ſhould be made by a combination of ſuch material ingredients. That faculty which has a perception of the habitudes, reſpects, and ſimilitudes betwixt things, which make no impreſſion upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſt neceſſarily have a ſpiritual and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial conſtitution.</p>
               <p>If the matter and form of the World did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merg and begin in time; they muſt either of their own accord, ſtart out of the Abyſs of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or elſe be fetched from thence by the energy of ſome ſuperiour power. The firſt muſt not be aſſerted. Nothing can be the cauſe of it ſelf, for then it would be before it was in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by conſequence, be and not be, at the ſame time. If the ſecond, then that Superior Power muſt be lodged in ſome intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This Being muſt have an Aſeity, and be entirely from himſelf, without dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any other; and therefore infinite in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, there being nothing higher to limit and ſet bounds unto him. And this is that which we mean by a God.</p>
               <p>As from the World in general, it appears there is a Deity: ſo likewiſe from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of which it conſiſts, the Heavens, the Earth, the Body, the Soul of Man. There is not a Star in the Firmament, but it ſhews
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49823:29"/>forth the glory of this Being. When we behold the heavenly Luminaries ſailing in the fluid body of the Air, we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that there is a skilful Pilot at the ſtern. If one born and educated within the caverns of the earth, ſhould be ſuddenly ſet upon the ſuperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of it in a clear night to take a proſpect, he would be inclined to ask the ſame queſtion, which he did, who ſaw the firſt ſhip arrive at <hi>Colchos,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He who can perſwade himſelf, that all theſe glorious Lights came there fortuitouſly, without the contrivance of an intelligent Being; may with as much eaſe believe, that paſſing through a City in a dark night, all the Candles which he meets with at every door, came there by chance.</p>
               <p>Indeed there are attempts made to ſalve the Celeſtial appearances with Matter, Figure and Motion. We are told, that Matter in diſtinct pieces being moved circularly, will by grinding one againſt the other, weare off the angular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances, and become perfectly circular: and that the anguloſe parts, which are broken off, will be of two ſorts, the leſſer, which are fit for motion: the greater, and more courſe, which by reaſon of their unevenneſs, are apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle one within another, and not to make their rounds with the ſame degree of celerity as the leſſer do. The finer ſort is called the firſt Element. The globular pieces the ſecond. The courſe rubbiſh the third. The firſt is ſuppoſed to conſtitute the Sun and fixed Stars. The ſecond, with ſome irregular particles to fill up the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular ſpaces betwixt them, the Heavens. The
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49823:30"/>third, the Planets and Comets. It being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to all matter in motion to move in a right line, there will be an endeavour in every part of it to recede from the Center; and therefore that which is moſt ſolid and able to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in motion, will be at the greateſt diſtance from the middle point.</p>
               <p>Yet all this doth not repreſent ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Heavens, as to exclude the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſals of an infinite Being. The Matter of which they conſiſt, the Laws, whereby the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter is regulated, have notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a dependence upon ſome intelligent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Matter cannot be of it ſelf: when it is made, it has no more motion than what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to it. The motion imparted could not produce ſo beautiful an Order, as is viſible in the World, were it not for ſome Laws which the Creator has impreſſed agreeable to his own nature.</p>
               <p>This Hypotheſis doth not only ſuppoſe a Deity as neceſſary upon the account of theſe particulars: but likewiſe in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſeveral Vortices within their due bounds and limits. For it repreſents the Heavens in a perfect ſtate of War; one Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex diſcharging its Globuli, ſhooting the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner irregular Particles out of the Ecclypticks into the Poles, and conſtantly thruſting one againſt another. If this be true, it cannot be imagined, how the Heavens above five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years together, ſhould continue with ſo few alterations as <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> have obſerved, in caſe there be no God, to limit every Vortex, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49823:30"/>the encroachment of the greater upon the leſs. No doubt, by this time, had not there been a Moderator to keep the ballance equal, the greater would have ſwallowed up the reſt; and the Star in the middle obtained an univerſal Monarchy. We have the more reaſon to believe that a divine hand is intereſted in this affair; becauſe when the Vortex we live in, has ſuck'd in any other, the Star which belongs to it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating into a Comet, is always believed to be ominous, and prophetical of ſome great thing, which the ſupreme Being is about to bring to paſs.</p>
               <p>As the Heavens, ſo likewiſe the Earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the exiſtence of a Deity. When we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſo vaſt a body encompaſſed with nothing which is viſible, but a fluid maſs of Air; the curioſities of Nature lock'd up in the bowels of it; the various ſorts of Plants which beautifie the ſuperficies; it is natural to conceive, that ſome inviſible Power is concerned in theſe effects.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is ſaid, that there are three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, known by the names of <hi>Sal, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are form'd in the interior Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Earth. The <hi>Mercury</hi> rarified by motion, being impatient of ſo cloſe a confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, takes its flight with the other two blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with it, into the upper region of the Earth, where they conſtitute Minerals, Plants, and whatſoever the earth we tread upon, is adorned with.</p>
               <p>This Hypotheſis is no prejudice to us; for it ſuppoſeth an intelligent Being as the firſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49823:31"/>Creator of matter, and Moderator of its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And when it is managed with the greateſt dexterity, comes very ſhort of giving true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about many terreſtrial Phaenomena, how they are produced in a Mechanical way. In it no proviſion is made for any reaſonble account of the variety of Plants; how it comes to paſs, that out of one and the ſame ſoil ſhould ſpring ſuch great diverſity as the earth is beautified with. If theſe did originally emerg out of a combination of various Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles aſcending from the interior region of the Earth; there muſt be a continuation of the like emanations for the nouriſhing of them: and if ſo, it is unaccountable, how the ſeveral ſtreams of Particles ſhould be able to find out amidſt ſuch great variety, as is ſometimes in a little ſpot of ground, all thoſe roots which they properly belong to. Neither can any good reaſon be given, in caſe all theſe ſhould be pull'd up, and Wheat, or any other Grain ſown in the room of them; how all thoſe Particles, (of which ſome are ſuppoſed inflexible) when they miſs of the roots, they are accuſtomed to, ſhould preſently change their figure, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as nutritive of the new body, as they had been formerly of the old. To ſay the Succus of the Earth is modified by the figure of the Root or Seed, is contrary to the Hypotheſis under conſideration; for it is ſuppoſed in it, that the interior region of the Earth, is the ſhop where all the Particles are forged. But let it be ſo, it is but neceſſary that thoſe who ſay it, ſhould give ſome account in a Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49823:31"/>way, how the Seed came to be in ſuch a mode or figure.</p>
               <p>This Hypotheſis likewiſe leaves us as much at a loſs, about the curioſities which appear in the compoſure of Plants. Whatſoever Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles may be drawn out of the bowels of the Earth, and elevated to the ſurface of it; yet it doth not appear by any Mechanical Law, how they ſhould fall into ſuch exact order, as to produce the elegant colours and curious proportions which are viſible in them. Were <hi>Archimedes</hi> preſent with his Compaſſes: or <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> with his Pencil, their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would fall very ſhort of that exactneſs which is obvious to every eye.</p>
               <p>There are as great difficulties about their various virtues. Whatſoever Succus aſcends to the exterior part of the Earth; it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, how it ſhould cauſe a Plant to ſpring up, which is hot in its operation, and within an inch of it, another cold; one aſtringent, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other laxative; one poiſonous, another nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; one grateful, another diſpleaſing to the palate. If this variety were the product only of ſome juice modified within the Earth, this juice muſt be Homogeneous, or Heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. NOt the firſt, becauſe it could not be the cauſe of ſo much variety. Not the ſecond, becauſe the ſoil many times, where ſuch Plants grow, is found in every part of it to be of the ſame Nature; as appears by its adminiſtring an equal nouriſhment (when the Plants are rooted up) to any kind of Seed which is ſown in the room of them.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49823:32"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Hypotheſis we ſpeak of, gives no account how a little kernel comes to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into the vaſt body of a Tree. How a grain of Muſtard the leaſt of all Seeds, ſhould become the greateſt of Herbs. Why the Thiſtle in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> ſhould not be as tall as the Cedar, or the Oak in <hi>Baſhan</hi> as low as the Hyſſop upon the wall. It has not yet been made to appear, by what force the Succus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends contrary to its own gravity: How it comes to climb in ſome Trees a yard, in others five: by what Law it is engaged to ſpread it ſelf into Arms and Branches, and what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple has ſet bounds which cannot be exceeded. So inſcrutable is the Wiſdom of him who framed the Earth; that the moſt profound inquiries into Nature are not able to diſcover all the methods of it. Something is induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concealed, to teach us, that the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which formed the Earth, far tranſcends all finite capacities.</p>
               <p>As the Earth; ſo the Men which inhabit it, declare the exiſtence of a Deity in their Bodies and Souls. 1. Their Bodies: He who takes a deliberate view of the compoſure of them, muſt neceſſarily be convinced of the interpoſals of Wiſdom in the contrivance. The uſual indications of Wiſdom are the aiming at ſome worthy deſign; the election of congruous means for the accompliſhment of it; and the actual bringing to paſs what is deſigned. All theſe are manifeſt to any who conſider the frame of a humane Body. It is manifeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be a convenient habitation for the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49823:32"/>Soul. This immortal Tenant, having a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able term of time to ſpend in it, and being of an active and vigorous nature, delighted with variety of objects; it is neceſſary, that its dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhould be repaired, be moveable, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with avenues, whereby it may entertain and perceive thoſe objects it meets with.</p>
               <p>In order to repairs, there could not be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſion of means contrived by all the Wiſdom in the World. Two rowes of Teeth are formed to prepare the nouriſhment by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication: an acid humor in the Ventricle, for the converſion of it into Chyle: ſtrait paſſages in the Inteſtines, for the ſeparation of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer part from the excrementitious: a convei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for it to the common Receptacle: <hi>Ductus</hi> to derive it from thence into the Veins; where by the potency of the Blood it is converted into the ſame nature: Ventricles in the Heart, for the entertainment of it: <hi>Valvulae</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the receſs, and the Hearts being charged with too great a quantity at one time, which might occaſion a ſuffocation: a paſſage out of the Ventricle into the Lungs, where the Air thro' the Larynk communicates a temper to it: a paſſage out of the Lungs, into the left, and from thence, by the branches of the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, into all the parts of the Body: <hi>Anaſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſes,</hi> or pores for the tranſmiſſion of it out of the Arteries into the Veins again; that the circulation may be continued for the repetition of the ſame work.</p>
               <p>That every part of the body may move, there is likewiſe a wiſe and accurate proviſion. The
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49823:33"/>immediate inſtruments of motion are the Muſcles. Beſides the Fleſh which is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their compoſition, they have Filaments or Fibres, which conſtitute the tendon or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament, whereby the Muſcle is tied to the part which it is deſigned to move. Beſides the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, there are Nerves, which ſerve as chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels to convey the Spirits. For the providing matter for the generation of Spirits, a vaſt quantity of Blood is prepared far exceeding what is found in other Animals. The Blood in the body of Man, bears the ſame proportion to the other parts of it, as one does to ten: So that if a Man weighs two hundred pounds, the Blood makes twenty of them. Whereas in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals it is but as one to twenty. For the diſtiling and ſtraining of the Spirits out of this matter, there is an elaboratory, namely the Brain, which in a Man is twice as much as in a Beaſt four times bigger in body. As Men are deſigned for more action than brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: ſo the preparations conducing to that purpoſe are greater. theſe Spirits commanded by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Soul into any part of the Body, ſwell the Muſcle, and cauſe it to attract, and pull the part, which it is tied unto.</p>
               <p>That the Soul may have a ſenſation of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal objects, their preparations are not inferior to thoſe for motion and nutrition. The Nerves, which ariſe in the Brain are diſperſed into all the parts of the Body: So that no member can be touched by any object, but the impreſſion is preſently conveyed into the Head. Tho' there is great variety in the modification of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49823:33"/>Senſes, yet there is nothing ſuperfluous. I will inſtance only in the Eye. It is lapped about with two coats, to defend it againſt the injuries of the Air: the outward is diaphanous in the forepart, for the admiſſion of the raies of light: The inward has an aperture for the ſame reaſon, which like a Curtain is moveable, that the <hi>Pupilla</hi> may be greater or leſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dimenſions or diſtance of the object. Theſe Coats are filled with three Humours, which refract the raies proceeding from the ſame point, and make them to meet again at the bottom of the Eye, which very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes diſtinct Viſion. The Cryſtalline Humor has on both ſides, the <hi>Proceſſus Ciliares,</hi> which ſerve as Tendons to alter the figure of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the object is nearer, or farther off.</p>
               <p>It will never enter into the belief of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Man, that this proviſion for nutrition, motion and ſenſation ſhould be accidental; and if any Wiſdom be intereſted in the contrivance of it, it muſt be our own, or our Parents, or the Wiſdom of an inviſible Being; neither we or they know any thing of it, and therefore there muſt be a Being in the World infinitely Wiſe, which can be no other, than what the true notion of a God imports.</p>
               <p>As the Body, ſo the Soul of Man evidently demonſtrates the exiſtence of a Deity. the Powers of it are Two, Underſtanding and Will. Theſe Two are ſo linked together; that what conduceth to the perfection of the one, never tends to the prejudice of the other. The Will is no loſer by any accompliſhment of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49823:34"/>nor the Underſtanding by any thing which is of ſincere advantage to the Will. If there be no God, the contrary will be true. For it is the perfection of the Underſtanding to know it, truth being its proper object; but the greateſt damage to the Will. No immorality will be diſguſted, when it comes to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that there is no Supreme Being to puniſh Vice and reward Virtue. If the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding know it not, this ignorance is a blemiſh to it; but a true advantage to the Will: there being nothing more efficacious to confine it within the bounds of Sobriety, than this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that there is a God.</p>
               <p>The Principles, as well as the Powers of the Soul, give evidence in this matter. As the falſe gods, had their characters impreſſed upon the bodies of thoſe, who worſhipped them: So the True God has ſet his ſignatures upon the Soul. there is a Law and a Conſcience in every Man, a Rule and a Judge: a Law which points out the difference betwixt Juſt and Unjuſt, Good and Evil, Virtue and Vice. This Rule is reduced in the Imperial Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to theſe Maximes. Nothing muſt be done which is a violation of Piety, Modeſty, Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We muſt not prejudice the eſtimation, liberty, and ſafety of others. We muſt give to every one that, which is his own. Theſe Axioms have the immediate effect of a Law, which is to bind and take away our freedom to do that which is contrary. Every Man is ſenſible that he is not at liberty to oppoſe the ſence of theſe Propoſitions in his converſation. In caſe he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49823:34"/>does (if there be any remains of humane nature in him) he finds himſelf under remorſe, and is really puniſhed in the loſs of that contentment, which a ſence of being employed in a good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is always accompanied with. There cannot be a ſtricter obligation than this; that a man muſt either do that, which the propoſitions import; or elſe loſe his true felicity. If this rule has the effect of a Law, which is to bind, it muſt have the eſſence and nature: the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is always a true indication of the nature of every thing: and if the nature, it muſt be made and impreſſed by ſome Sovereign Power. The Legiſlative Power is never veſted in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior. This Sovereign which made and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed this Law, muſt have a dominion over all mankind; becauſe all, whether Princes or Peaſants, are ſenſible of their obligations in this particular. Therefore there muſt be a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and inviſible Power in the World, which is that which we mean by the Deity.</p>
               <p>As there is a Law in the Soul which argues the exiſtence of God; ſo likewiſe a Conſcience. This ſignifies the judgment of every Man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about his own actions, as they bear a proportion or diſproportion to the Divine Law. Upon a diſcovery of guilt, condemnation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently paſſeth, and as great a conſternation follows as that in a malefactor, when he hears the ſentence of death denounced againſt him. Tho' in a time of proſperity, when all things are quiet and ſerene, the intellectual pulſe may be very ſlow: yet when a ſtorm ariſeth, it is quickly awakened in the moſt exorbitant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49823:35"/>Every clap of Thunder is believed to be a meſſenger ſent from Heaven to ſerve an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt upon them. When they make the faireſt appearance in the World, they are like a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy bound up in guilt leather; without there is ſplendor, within tumults and murder. Their external Triumphs, like the Drums of <hi>Tophet,</hi> help only to drown the unwelcom reports of their uneaſie Spirits. Theſe direful fears, which haunt the Soul, when it is no way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the animadverſions of humane ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, evidently declare; that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible power in the World, which has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them; and ſtands prepared to give it a taſte of the moſt ſevere animadverſions of his diſpleaſure.

The fear they themſelves are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of, argues the reality of what they make uſe of.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that it is natural to the Soul to be diſturbed, when it perverts the order of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Nature, and acts contrary to its own judgment; this is in effect to grant all that is contended for. Nature doth not only work a trouble upon this occaſion; but raiſes fears upon the account of a Deity, and a future ſtate, in which the obliquities of this life are to be puniſhed: All which would be in vain and to no purpoſe, did not ſuch an Infinite Being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt: and it is uſually entertained as a maxim, that Nature acts nothing in vain.</p>
               <p>As the Powers and Principles of Intellectual Nature argue the exiſtence of a Deity: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the univerſal practice of all who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with it. All Nations agree that there is a God, to whom they are obliged to pay their reverential and honorary regards: the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49823:36"/>Wiſeſt, who have more underſtanding than to be impoſed upon: the Fooliſheſt, who have not ſo much as to give any juſt reaſon to think, that they act with a deſign to impoſe upon others. The <hi>Americans,</hi> who have been moſt ſuſpected of not being concerned in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acknowledgment, are upon a diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, found to have their <hi>Caribee</hi> or Prieſts, which they believe do converſe with Spirits, and think themſelves under an obligation to give to thoſe Spirits a Religious Worſhip. This conſent and agreement amongſt Nations at a great diſtance one from another, can have no other original, than an univerſal impreſſion made upon them by a Divine Hand. No other cauſe can be conceived of an equal latitude to this effect.</p>
               <p>If in this univerſal practice all are under a deception, they muſt be impoſed upon either by Spirits, or by Men, or by their own fancies.</p>
               <p>If by Spirits, they muſt be good or bad. The good will not be ſo injurious as to ſeduce Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The bad are not ſo unpolitick, as to beget an errour contrary to their own intereſt.</p>
               <p>If by Men, it muſt be before their diſperſion, when they had opportunities of converſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If then ſuch a Notion was ſtarted, and ever ſince communicated from one generation to another, and received by all the people in the World, it is an evident teſtimony of ſome reality in it. The fire will not kindle, except the fuel be diſpoſed. This notion would not have found ſo univerſal an entertainment, had not the Soul been prepared for it by an innate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49823:36"/>Principle and inclination. There is no fiction, of which there has been ſo univerſal a retenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Polytheiſm, which laies the higheſt claim to univerſality, was diſowned by the wiſeſt of the Heathens; as is evident by the Treatiſe aſcribed to <hi>Juſt in Martyr, De Monarchia Dei,</hi> by S. <hi>Cyprian, de Idolorum vanitate,</hi> by <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, de falſâ religione. Plato, Plutarch, Celſus, Porphyry, Hierocles, Julian,</hi> have plainly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is but one Supreme Being. When more gods are mentioned, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand either Angels, or Deiſied Men, or only various names of the Supreme Being, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the diverſe benefits, which Mankind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him. The Pagan Deity was either made, or unmade. The Heathens had many Gods, which were made: but they had but One, which was unmade, and uſually known by the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, All cannot be impoſed upon in this particular, by their own Fancies. Imagination is always floating, and inclined to change. It is unaccountable, how all the World ſhould come to fix upon the ſame fancy, and retain it with ſo much reſolution in all Ages, as not to be diſpoſſeſſed of it, by the moſt plauſible inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations: conſidering eſpecially, that it has ſome oppoſition to our natural tempers, as we are finite, corporeal, ſinful. A Finite Being is loſt and ſwallowed up, when it applies it ſelf to conceive of that which is Infinite. We are ſo inured to corporeal objects; that the Idea of an immaterial Being is with great difficulty impreſſed upon us.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49823:37"/>
               <p>By Nature we are under ſuch ſtrong propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Sin; that we are unwilling to think of any thing, which may curb our enormous inclinations.</p>
               <p>If the belief of a Deity, was the product of Imagination, it is ſtrange, that a Man, when beſieged with the moſt potent arguments, and naturally diſpoſed by a depraved temper to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, ſhould not ſurrender up this Fancy; but ſtill perſevere in its defence.</p>
               <p>If, nowithſtanding all this, any ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the want of evidence for the exiſtence of a God; I deſire them, in order to the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe from their unbelief, ſeriouſly to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have as much evidence for it, as we have for thoſe things, which we doubt not of. If we hear at a diſtance an Inſtrument of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, we queſtion not, but there is a hand which plaies upon it, altho' we ſee it not. If we diſcern a Ship upon the Sea, bending its courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Heaven, we conclude there is a Pilot within, tho' he is not ſeen by us. We have as much reaſon to believe; when we ſeriouſly ponder the harmonious compoſure of the parts of the World, their regular tendencies, to their ſeveral ends; that there is an Intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, altho' he does not immediately fall under the notice of any of our Senſes. If we muſt believe nothing but what we ſee, we can have no aſſurance of the reality of our Souls. We never ſaw that incorporeal ſubſtance whereby we are animated. We muſt be as uncertain about the Principles of our Bodies, they are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49823:37"/>made (as all other matter is) of ſuch minute particles, that when ſeparated, are not big enough to make an impreſſion upon the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Senſation. The greateſt body may by diviſion be reduced to ſuch a ſtate; that the parts cannot be ſeen, and yet we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, they are not annihilated. The Particles which conſtantly ſwarm about the Load-ſtone; the effluviums which iſſue out of ſome Bodies, and at their return apprehend, and fetch in the matter, which lies within the Sphere of their activity. We perceive not with any of our Senſes, and yet the effects produced by them will not ſuffer us to doubt of their reality.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have as much aſſurance of the Truth of this Propoſition (a Deity doth exiſt) as we have of the cleareſt Axiom in Philoſophy. the ground of certainty is nothing but a neceſſary and evident connexion betwixt the Subject and Predicate. But there is no Maxim, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Predicate are more cloſely united, than the parts of this Propoſition. In the notion of a Deity neceſſary exiſtence is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and in the notion of neceſſary exiſtence the nature of a Deity. God doth neceſſarily exiſt: and that which neceſſarily exiſts, can be no other but God. The parts of the Enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are reciprocal, which argues Truth in the higheſt Degree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Propoſition is not only equal to others: but has the advantage in ſome reſpects. If it be ſuppoſed that the exiſtence of a Deity is poſſible, it will from thence follow that it is actual. For that is properly ſaid to be poſſible,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49823:38"/>when there is no repugnancy at all, why it may not exiſt: and if there be no repugnancy to hinder the exiſtence of a Deity, It is ſuppoſed, that there is a cauſe in Being, which is able to make it exiſt. A paſſive power in any thing to be what it is not, ſuppoſeth an active power, which is able to make the mutation. This active power cannot be lodged in the Deity it ſelf, conſidered only as poſſible. No meer poſſible can be the ſubject of an active power. If in any thing diſtinct, it muſt be either an Inferior, or Superior, or that which is equal to the Deity. An Inferior can produce nothing which is more excellent than it ſelf. There can be no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that which is boundleſs in perfection. If in an equal, then there is ſomething already in Being, which is infinite in power, which can be no other, but God.</p>
               <p>If it be ſuppoſed as impoſſible, that a Deity ſhould exiſt, the ſame conſequence will follow. For if it be impoſſible, then all Beings are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally finite, and limited: and if ſo, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them muſt be either infinite or finite. An infinite number cannot be. The parts of all number being eſſentially finite, the product muſt be of the ſame nature. If finite, then it muſt have the common bounds, a firſt and a laſt. If a firſt, that firſt muſt be of it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dependence in point of cauſality: for Entity in order of Nature preceding Energy; if the firſt Being was produced by an operation, that action muſt ſlow from a pre-exiſtent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and if it be of it ſelf, it muſt be infinite. Whatſoever is finite, receives its bounds from
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49823:38"/>ſome cauſe. Entity, conſidered as poſſible, being limitable divers ways, and indifferent to what ſpecies it is determined to: there can be no account given, why it ſhould come forth into Act, and exiſt rather under one ſpecies than another, were there not ſome pre-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Cauſe. The thing it ſelf cannot be this Cauſe; for then it had a Being, before it was finite: nor any other diſtinct thing; becauſe the Being, we ſpeak of, is ſuppoſed to be firſt. This Truth is ſo vigorous, that the depreſſing of it with this ſuppoſition, makes it like the Palm, to ariſe with the greater force.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If we do but conſult the familiar dictates of our underſtandings, they will not fail to lead us into the knowledge of this Truth. They naturally ſuggeſt to us, that ſomething muſt be Eternal. This Eternal muſt be either the preſent Syſteme of the World, or the Cauſe of it. The firſt cannot be aſſerted as I have before demonſtrated. If the ſecond, this Cauſe muſt be either meer matter, or elſe an immaterial and ſpiritual ſubſtance. Matter it cannot be. In its productions the deepeſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is diſcovered, which Matter is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of. If an immaterial and intellectual ſubſtance; then there is an eternal Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſupereminent Power and Wiſdom, which is the true notion of a God.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that ſuch a Spirit cannot be the efficient of the World, becauſe he had no matter to frame it out of; and it is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged, that out of nothing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be made. I anſwer, that this Maxim
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49823:39"/>muſt be limited to a finite power. A Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with that, which is infinite, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be able to create all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. If an imperfect Being is able out of nothing, to make a new mode, as we daily ſee in the cogitations of the Mind, and in the motions of the Body, Much more muſt that, which is abſolute in perfection, be able to form a new ſubſtance. He who eminently contains all things in himſelf cannot be denied a power to exert a tranſient action, and by it to give ſome outward expreſſion of what is in himſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible and permanent effects. It is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to conceive, how a thing ſhould be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal without any cauſe, which all grant to be true: than to apprehend, how a finite Being may be produced out of nothing by an Infinite Power.</p>
               <p>He who ſeriouſly ponders the evidence that is given for the exiſtence of a Deity, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in his infidelity, has nothing to lay the blame upon, but his own obſtinacy, or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to have any thing true, which may be a curb to his enormous inclinations. If he will not be perſwaded that any thing is certain, but that, which is the object of his ſenſe; all teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies whether divine or humane, to him are made of no ſignification; and no place will be left for Faith, which is converſant about things not ſeen, and reſts ſatisfied with teſtimonies, whoſe verity there is no juſt reaſon to ſuſpect. Every thing is not capable of the ſame degree of evidence: but if it has ſo much, as its nature requires, common reaſon will condemn us, if we believe it not.</p>

This is not done in imitation of the ſtile of Princes, who to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their grandeur, make uſe of this number. If this mode of ſpeaking had been occaſioned by that cuſtom, it would have been conſtantly uſed at the giving of the Law, when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty was diſplaied in the moſt awful circumſtances: and yet then we meet with the ſingular number. Princes uſe it only in the firſt perſon.

The <hi>Jews</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrong propenſions to Idolatry; this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was not then ſet in the fulleſt light, that no occaſion might be from thence taken to confirm them in their errour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Three, are not three manifeſtations only of God. If they did import nothing more, no reaſon can be given, why the number ſhould be thus confined. Since the Creation there have been many ſignal Manifeſtations of the Deity far exceeding this number. A manifeſtation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome diſcovery of that which was ſecret before, and by conſequence muſt be made in time: but the holy Scripture attributes Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Father, the Son, and the bleſſed Spirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe Three, are not three names only of the ſame God under divers inadequate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. For then, when it is ſaid, that Chriſt was baptized, the Holy Ghoſt deſcended, a voice came from the Father, the meaning would be, that one name of God was baptized, another deſcended in the form of a Dove, a third ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a voice; than which nothing can be more incongruous. Nay, when a command is given to baptiſed in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, the ſence will amount to no more than this: go and baptiſe in the name of three Names. This explication of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not reconcileable with the ſcope of S. <hi>John,</hi> when he aſſerts, that <hi>there are three, which bear record in heaven.</hi> For the reaſon, why he mentions three, is to evidence, that there is a ſufficient number of witneſſes to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that Jeſus is the Chriſt. Now if by the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49823:40"/>Three are meant only three names of the ſame perſon, the Apoſtle fails of his end, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as guilty of a manifeſt colluſion. He does, as if a man ſhould undertake to prove Oratory an excellent Art by three witneſſes, and produce only the three names of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>Marcus, Tullius, Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. All things required to the conſtitution of a perſon, belong to them. A Perſon is an intelligent Being, which has a peculiar ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. This definition agrees to the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit. They have, all, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and Knowledge. The Father is ſaid to know the Son, and the Son the Father. The Holy Ghoſt is ſtiled a Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding. They have peculiar ſubſiſtence. The Father is without communication from another. The Son is from the Father. The Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son. His proceſſion from the Father is aſſerted in expreſs words, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. From the Son ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Miſſion of the Comforter in the ſame Verſe. For as the Father is ſent of none, becauſe he is of himſelf; the Son is ſent of the Father, becauſe he is of the Father: ſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is repreſented as ſent by the Father and the Son, becauſe he proceeds from both. Now he who is begotten or proceeds, muſt neceſſarily be diſtinct from him, by whom he is begotten, and from whom he proceeds; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence have a peculiar mode of ſubſiſtence. The Father's being in the Son, and the Son in the Father, doth not deſtroy this diſtinction. God is in every man, and every man in God.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49823:41"/>In him we live and move and have our Being, and yet the diſcrimination remains betwixt the divine and humane ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such Actions are attributed to theſe three as belong to none but a perſon. It will be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to inſtance in thoſe, which are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Father and the Son. All the doubt is about the Spirit; and yet the Scripture is very clear in this particular. He is ſaid to know, will,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30.</note> create, preſerve. Theſe actions are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted indications of a perſon. Actions are attributed to things either properly or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly. Whenſoever they are attributed to them in the firſt ſence, they are infallible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ſuppoſitality. <hi>Actiones ſunt ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</hi> And it is apparent, that when they are attributed to the Spirit, it is not always in an improper and figurative ſence. He is ſaid to make interceſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> If this action be aſſigned to the Spirit improperly or tropically then it may be properly attributed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, according to the <hi>Socinian</hi> notion, uſeth the Spirit as a power or virtue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce what he deſigns, (even as thoſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are aſcribed to Charity, in a tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. properly belong to the Man which is indued with it, and makes uſe of it as a moral power or virtue.) But Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, betwixt the Father and us, cannot with any congruity, be ſaid to be made by the Father himſelf. The Father is one party, and we the other. Where there are two parties, Interceſſion ſuppoſes the interpoſition of a third perſon.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:49823:41"/>
               <p>All this makes it manifeſt, why the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are repreſented in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as Three Perſons.</p>
               <p>The perſonality of the Father is mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. The Son is ſaid to be his expreſs Image, which can import no leſs, than that he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon like unto his Father. The Holy Spirit is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, another Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like unto the Son. He is ſet forth by the demonſtrative Pronoun <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an undoubted note of perſonality. If in any humane Writing, the matter of which was never drawn into controverſie by the pride or prejudice of a Party, ſuch expreſſions, as theſe, ſhould occur. He ſhall teach you. He ſhal bring all things to your remembrance, He ſhall teſtifie of me, He will reprove the World, He will guide you into all Truth, He ſhall glorifie me, and that He, who is to do all this, proceeds from the Father, and is ſent by the Son: We ſhould account him a very abſurd Interpreter: that ſhould ſay, that the He ſo often repeated is not a perſon, nor perſonally diſtinct from him by whom he is ſent, and from whom he proceeds. All this is aſſerted in the Scripture of the Holy Ghoſt. The <hi>Socinians</hi> willingly grant an eternal perſonality to the Father, but deny it to the Son and the Spirit. They ſay, that the Son is a Perſon but not eternal, that the Holy Ghoſt is neither a Perſon, nor eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: but a Power and Virtue from God, or an effect produced by that Power: and yet the perſonality of the Son, muſt be as early as his Filiation, and his Filiation or Sonſhip is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49823:42"/>eternal. The Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> ſaies, <hi>His goings forth have been from old, from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> c. 5. v. 2.</p>
               <p>The Spirit cannot always ſignifie Power, or an effect produced by the Power. The Spirit and Power are plainly diſtinguiſhed. Jeſus is ſaid to return in the power of the Spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. S. <hi>Paul</hi> prays, that the <hi>Romans</hi> may abound in hope thro' the power of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 14. Mighty ſigns and wonders are ſaid to be done by the power of the Spirit of God. If the Spirit in theſe places did ſignifie no more than a divine power, the meaning would be, that Chriſt returned, the <hi>Romans</hi> abounded, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wrought thro' the power of a Power.</p>
               <p>The Spirit is likewiſe evidently diſtinguiſhed from effects or gifts. The Apoſtle ſaies, that <hi>There are diverſity of gifts, but the ſame Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.4. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of Wiſdom, to another the word of Knowledge by the ſame Spirit, v.</hi> 8. And that all theſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this one and the ſame Spirit. So that there can be nothing left in theſe Texts for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to ſignifie but a Perſon: He being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly diſtinguiſhed from the Divine Power, and the gifts and products of that Power. Now I have finiſhed the ſecond Propoſition. <hi>In the Godhead there are Three Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Theſe Three are One God.</hi> Unity is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the Deity, Plurality proceeds from the fecundity and fruitfulneſs of Cauſes: but God is of himſelf without dependence upon any Cauſe. If there be more Gods, there muſt be more Infinites in the ſame kind; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49823:42"/>a contradiction, for one infinite Being contains all perfection, not only as conſidered in the general notion, but actually: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is none for any other Deity to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with, and poſſeſſed of, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If there be more Gods, they muſt be diſtinct one from another. This diſtinction muſt ariſe from ſome diverſity in Nature; to attribute ſuch diverſity to the Divine Nature, is to make a diſhonourable reflection upon the ſimplicity of it. <hi>The Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are this One God.</hi> 1. The Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts that they are one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. Tho' theſe words are not found in ſome Copies, yet they are extant in more than they are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in: and in that which is dubious, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is according to the ſuffrage of the major part. If ſuch an addition has been made to the Text, it muſt be done before or after the two firſt General Councils. If before, it was either accidental, or intentional. Not Accidental thro' the inadvertency of the Scribe. For tho' a Scribe may miſtake, and leave out letters and words; yet it cannot be imagined, that he ſhould caſually without any deſign, add a whole ſentence; and not preſently upon a review (which may be juſtly preſumed in a Writing of ſuch importance) diſcover and correct his errour.</p>
               <p>Not Intentional; no good reaſon can be given, why any ſhould induſtriouſly make ſuch a ſpurious inſertion, before the controverſie concerning the Deity of Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt did commence.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49823:43"/>
               <p>Neither was the addition, which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, made after the two firſt General Councils. Becauſe the words we ſpeak of, are found in thoſe Copies, which the Fathers, who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Councils, made uſe of. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts <hi>de Patre, Filio, &amp;c.</hi> Of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, it is written, and theſe Three are One.</p>
               <p>This gives us juſt reaſon to believe, that the Copies in which theſe words are wanting, fell into the hands of the <hi>Arrians:</hi> and that a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was made by them. 2. As the words of S. <hi>John</hi> aſſure us; that <hi>The Father, the Son and the Spirit are One:</hi> ſo we are aſſured by other texts of Sacred Writ, that this Unity is in the Divine Eſſence. They have all one and the ſame infinite Nature. This is evident by the attribution of the Name, Properties, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Operations of the moſt High God to them. None doubt of this relation to the Father: The matter is likewiſe clear concerning the Son and the Spirit. Chriſt is called the <hi>mighty God,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. <hi>God bleſſed for evermore,</hi> Rom. 9.5. <hi>The true God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. <hi>The moſt high God,</hi> Pſal. 58.17, 56. The moſt High which the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> tempted and provoked in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is expreſly called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. The name of God is never attributed, in the ſacred Oracles, with ſuch emphatical Epithets, to any finite Being. They are intentionally inſerted, to ſignifie, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> is ſtiled God, not upon the account of his Embaſſy from his Father, or a deification in the ſtate of Glory; but his infinite Nature. He, who is made God, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49823:43"/>is not ſo eſſentially, cannot be ſaid to be the true, mighty, moſt High, God bleſſed for evermore.</p>
               <p>As the Name of God, ſo the Properties of the Divine Nature are attributed to him. Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.17. Immutability, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.11. Omnipotence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. Eternity. He is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is, which was, which is to come, <hi>v.</hi> 4. Eternity compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all differences of time. Was he but a meer Creature, ſuch perfections could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in him. A finite Being, under the greateſt Elevation, has not a capacity large enough to entertain and receive ſuch boundleſs excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>The peculiar Operations of God are likewiſe attributed to him, as <hi>Creation, Joh.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.16. God is ſaid <hi>to create all things by Jeſus Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 3.9. The Son did concur with the Father and the Spirit in this great Work, as a co-ordinate cauſe. The Nature of Creation will not admit the interpoſals of an inſtrument. There being no matter to prepare, a phyſical inſtrument has nothing to do in the caſe: And Chriſt is repreſented as more than a Moral. The infinite power, whereby all things are made, is often aſcribed to him, which is never done to a meer moral inſtrument, ſuch as the Apoſtles were in the production of Miracles.</p>
               <p>Conſervation is likewiſe aſcribed to him. He is ſaid <hi>to uphold all things with the word of his power, Heb.</hi> 1.3. It was uſual for the <hi>Jews</hi> to expreſs the Deity by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> power, and therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is here inſerted to aſſure
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49823:44"/>them; that Chriſt ſuſtains the World, and prevents its relapſe into its primitive Abyſs by virtue of his Deity. Laſtly, He is ſaid to work Miracles. He made the blind to ſee, the lame to walk, the dead to revive. This he did not bring to paſs by any mutuatitious power. When he healed the multitude, it is ſaid, <hi>Virtue went out of him, Luk.</hi> 6.19. The power, whereby he did it, was not adventitious, but innate. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> wrought a miracle, that Chriſt by whoſe power it was effected, might not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the glory of it, he names him as the principal cauſe. His name <hi>thro' faith in his name hath made this man whole, Act.</hi> 3.16. As the name, properties and operations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature are attributed to the Son of God: So likewiſe to the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. is ſtiled the God of <hi>Iſrael. Ananias</hi> who <hi>lied unto the Spirit, Act.</hi> 5.3. is ſaid <hi>to lie unto God, v.</hi> 4. The body, which is <hi>the Temple of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19 is ſtiled <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>He is Eternal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7. Omniſcient, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. Omnipreſent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. The whole Creation is repreſented as the effect of his power. The hoſt of Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. Man the principal Work of God upon the Earth, <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. The Fiſh in the Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.3. are all of his formation.</p>

               <p>To aſſert, that all this is attributed to the Spirit; becauſe God makes uſe of him, as an inſtrument, to effect his Work, will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the difficulty. For there is ſome work attributed to the Spirit, to which no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can concur, as Creation.

               <p>If any ſhall be ſo in love with his private Sentiments, as to deny this Truth, which has
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49823:46"/>gained ſo univerſal a Teſtimony, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome difficulties, which our ſhallow Intellects cannot reach to the bottom of; he may with the ſame reaſon aſſert there is no ſuch thing as the Ocean, becauſe he cannot by his line find the depth of it in every place. If all this will not ſatisfie; let him exerciſe his reaſon about ſome difficulties in nature, and he will find the exiſtence of things very plain where their contexture is ſo concealed, and intricate; that the greateſt Wits are at a loſs in their diſquiſition about it. If the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of ſome modes in natural things be no reaſonable inducement to deny the reality of the things themſelves: much leſs is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable union betwixt the Divine Eſſence and Subſiſtence, a juſtifiable plea for the denial of the Sacred Trinity. He that ſhall think fit to try the acuteneſs of his Intellect about ſome knots in Philoſophy; will find the edge of his reaſon ſo much blunted in the encounter; that it will not be eaſie for him to perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that it is ſharp enough to penetrate into all the Myſteries in Divinity.</p>
               <p>If this will not prevail, without an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with thoſe difficulties, which this Truth is uſually aſſaulted with, let a Catalogue be made of them, and it will not be difficult for him, to make his way thro' them, who is armed with the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Altho' there be Three Perſons, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences in the Godhead: yet there are not three Eſſences. Every Perſon diſtinctly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered has an Eſſence: but every perſon has not a diſtinct Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49823:47"/>2. Tho' one finite individual Nature cannot be communicated to Three Perſons: yet an infinite may. If the whole Divine Eſſence is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately in all created perſons at the ſame time; there is no reaſon to think, but that it may be communicated to three increated. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is alledged againſt this Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, holds as ſtrong againſt the Univerſal Preſence, which all acknowledge, but thoſe who deny the Deity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Finite and infinite, perfect and imperfect, are not proper predicates of Subſiſtence, but of Being. So that when we are interrogated, whether the three perſons in the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are finite or infinite, perfect or imperfect: if by Perſon is meant only a mode of ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence without the Nature, it is a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous queſtion. For infinity and finity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and imperfection are but modes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: and every mode imports variation; and one variation cannot properly be predicated of another. If by Perſon is underſtood the Divine Eſſence ſubſiſting in a peculiar manner, then we anſwer, that every perſon diſtinctly is infinitely perfect: tho' every perſon has not a diſtinct infinite perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Altho' the three Perſons have one and the ſame Nature: yet the Son cannot be ſaid to be the Father, or the Spirit the Son. The ſame ſpecifical Nature agrees to <hi>Joh, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> Every one of them has the whole nature of Man; yet we have no reaſon to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that <hi>Moſes</hi> is <hi>Job,</hi> or <hi>Joh Daniel.</hi> As there is ſome thing not contained in the common
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49823:47"/>Nature, which doth individuate them: So there is a characteriſtical property appertaining to the Father, the Son and holy Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are diſtinguiſht; altho' they are all equally intereſted in the ſame infinite Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When it is ſaid, that the only God is the Father, Jeſus Chriſt is the only God, therefore Jeſus Chriſt is the Father; the major propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is peccant. For in every propoſition the predicate is never leſs comprehenſive than the ſubject; but always of a greater latitude, and therefore bears the title of the major term. But here the predicate, <hi>Father,</hi> is leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive than the ſubject, the <hi>only God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I have finiſhed the Third Propoſition, <hi>The Three Perſons are One God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This One God is to be Worſhipped.</hi> If we conſider him eſſentially, his peerleſs perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do juſtly challenge the deepeſt veneration. They being infinite cannot admit of any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All that We are capable of doing is to own them with the decent ſignifications of the moſt humble and ſubmiſſive regards. It is an Article in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Creed,<note place="margin">Fag. in Deut. c. <hi>14.</hi> v. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Bleſſed God is worthy to be Worſhipped.</hi> It is a principal part of the Confeſſion of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory and Honour.</hi> It was uſual among the Heathens to worſhip the Head of great Rivers.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sax.</hi> Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip.</note> He who conſiders God as the fountain of all that goodneſs which circulates in the veins of the Creation, can conclude no leſs than that the moſt profound veneration is due to him.</p>
               <p>If the Deity be conſidered perſonally, every
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49823:48"/>perſon doth require Divine Worſhip to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to him. The Father, <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.23. The Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> directed his Prayer to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> enjoyned S. <hi>Paul</hi> to call upon him, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 16. Salvation is promiſed to thoſe, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a conformity to this command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. When we ſay, the Son is to be Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, we do not conſider him without his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, but as a perſon conſiſting both of Divine and Humane. Supreme Adoration is given upon the account of the infinite excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Divine Nature. This excellency is communicated to the Perſon which has aſſumed our Nature, and advanced it to the dignity of an Hypoſtatical union; but not to the nature it ſelf. And therefore the Worſhip which is due, muſt not be terminated upon the nature conſidered abſtractedly, but the perſon who is clothed with it. This induced <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> to ſay,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Adelph.</note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let them know (meaning the <hi>Arrians</hi>) that when we Worſhip the Lord in the fleſh, we do not Worſhip a Creature: but the Creator cloathed with a created body.</p>
               <p>Neither muſt our bleſſed. Lord be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without his Mediatorſhip. Tho' ſupreme Adoration doth not immediately terminate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the relation of a Mediator: yet it doth upon him, who is inveſted with that Relation. Our Saviour in this reſpect is inferiour to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and nothing inferiour to the Deity can challenge Supreme Adoration. The taking up the mediatory Office was an act of free Grace,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49823:48"/>and by conſequence might not have been done. Now that which might have been, or not been, muſt be inferiour to that neceſſary and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table excellency, which is the proper Object of the higheſt Veneration. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the foundation of Worſhip and the Motives to it. Tho' the free acts of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Benignity, as redeeming, mediating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are vigorous inducements to Worſhip: yet the ſole foundation and immediate object is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite excellency, which will not permit any thing which is inferiour, to ſhare with it in the ſame degree of Honour. A Subject may have many motives from the perſonal favours of his Prince, to pay the Rights which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Crown: yet the formal object and reaſon of his ſo doing, is the Sovereignty, and dominion, which the Prince is inveſted with.</p>
               <p>As the Son, ſo likewiſe the Spirit is the Object of Adoration. He is placed in the ſame rank with the Father, and the Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.5, 7. and honoured with the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the peculiarities of the Deity, as Eternity, Immenſity, Omniſcience. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour done to him by Blaſphemy has as black a character in the Scripture, as the diſhonour of the Father or Son. It is repreſented as a delinquency of the firſt magnitude, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the benefit of pardon. He who is thus dignified, and ſecured by the moſt ſevere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination againſt diſhonour, muſt neceſſarily of right challenge the ſame degree of Honour and Worſhip, which is due to the Father and the Son.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:49823:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The Adoration, given to them all, muſt be ſo directed; that we may worſhip the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity. The ground of divine Veneration is the unlimited and peerleſs perfection of God. The motives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to it are the benefits, which none but ſo tranſcendent a Being can conferr. The ſame internal eminency is common to the Three Perſons. Every external benefit is the product of their joint concurrence. They having all an equal intereſt in the foundation of Religion, and the motives conducing to it; it is very reaſonable, when we direct an act of Worſhip to one; that we ſhould not exclude the other. When we name the Son only, the Father and holy Spirit are to be underſtood: or the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, the Son and the Spirit: or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only, the Father and the Son. Conſonant to this doctrine are the words of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us Worſhip in Three one Deity: and the practice of the univerſal Church, which is apparent, by the Latin, and Greek Liturgies. Now I have done with the fourth Propoſition, <hi>This One God is to be Worſhipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This God is only to be Worſhiped.</hi> This is the expreſs aſſertion of the Holy Scripture, the dictate of Reaſon, the ſence of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The aſſertion of Holy Scripture. It is the firſt of the moral Laws, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me:</hi> and placed in the front of the Goſpel, <hi>Him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> In a ſenſe of this appropriate allegiance to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Angel did forbid S. <hi>John,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49823:49"/>
                  <hi>Barnabas</hi> the people of <hi>Lycaonia</hi> to pay them any Divine Veneration. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s refuſal of the portion of meat, which was firſt conſecrated to an Idol, will eaſily induce us to believe, that he had an equal diſguſt of the Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was given to him. If <hi>Abraham</hi>'s deportment, when the Angels appeared, had more than a moral or civil reſpect; The Son of God his being in the company will excuſe him from Idolatry, one of them is expreſly dignified with the incommunicable name of the Deity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The dictate of reaſon. Worſhip is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internal, or external. Internal includes a deep and reverential eſteem, as an ingredient eſſential to its nature. This eſteem muſt be of an elevation agreeable to the excellency of the Object it is terminated upon. There being no object, that can be a Rival with the Supreme Being in point of perfection, it is not poſſible, that the ſame eſteem, which his tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent dignity challengeth from us, ſhould with juſtice be given to any other.</p>
               <p>External imports a declaration of inward eſteem by ſome outward acts. As the Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion terminated upon God is peculiar and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate: So muſt the Acts be, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the ſignification of it. Betwixt the ſign and the thing ſignified there ought to be ſuch a ſimilitude; that the one may be known by the other. This cannot be done in the preſent caſe; except there be ſuch an appropriation, as we ſpeak of.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49823:50"/>
               <p>The nature of Divine Supremacy requires in outward as well as inward Worſhip a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrimination from that which is given to the Creature. Earthly Monarchs expect an agni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Sovereignty to be made by the payment of an appropriate homage. They have ſome Jewels in their Crown, which they will not permit any of their Subjects to wear. Tho' Moral and Civil regards may be tendred to a Creature: yet if they riſe ſo high as to have any mixtures of thoſe peculiarities, which are devoted by nature or inſtitution to ſignifie Divine Veneration: they are as diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, as it would be to a Prince to ſtand by, and ſee the Allegiance, which is due only to himſelf, given to another.</p>
               <p>This Truth is warranted with ſo much clear reaſon; that thoſe, who have had no other advantage but the light of Nature, have taken notice of it. Among thoſe inſtructions which <hi>Orpheus</hi> left with <hi>Muſaeus,</hi>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe Truths, which are owned by the moſt early Writers, this is of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; that <hi>God only is to be Worſhipped.</hi> They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mention the worſhipping any thing elſe, as the Sacrament, the Croſs, the Relicks of Saints.</p>
               <p>When they delineate the rites appertaining to the Euchariſt, there is not the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Veneration, which, the <hi>Romaniſt;</hi> ſay, is due to the Sacrament. They were far from aſſerting, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>quae debetur vero Deo,</hi> is to be given to it. Circumſtances, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accidental, as the time when the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made, the place where, the mingling Water with Wine, are recorded. Thoſe who had leiſure to preſerve the memory of theſe circumſtances, would not have omitted a point ſo material, in caſe any ſuch thing had been known to be agreeable to the mind of God.</p>
               <p>As for the individual Croſs, upon which our bleſſed Lord ſuffered; there could be no Adoration directed to it, for the firſt three hundred years. It is confeſſed, that it lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed under ground till the time of <hi>Helena,</hi> mother to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. Neither is there the leaſt ſignification of any religious addreſſes made to artificial imitations of it.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49823:51"/>perſwade us, that the Chriſtians Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Head of an Aſs: becauſe their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries were as peremptory in this as the other charge. <hi>Tertullian</hi> reckons the report, that the Chriſtians were <hi>Crucis religioſi,</hi> amongſt thoſe ſcandals, which were raiſed by malice, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the eclipſing their reputation.</p>
               <p>As for the Relicks of Saints; we find no mention of any religious reſpect, which was paid to them. Thoſe who have the greateſt zeal for them, are uſually mounted upon tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: but finding it not able to carry them thro' the firſt Centuries in this particular, they think good to alight, and content themſelves with ſome inſtances in Scripture, which are nothing to the purpoſe: as the hemm of Chriſt's garment, the ſhadow of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Handkerchiefs and Aprons, that touched the body of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Becauſe the Woman diſeaſed with an iſſue of blood, was healed by touching the firſt: the ſick were brought into the ſtreets, that they might be overſhadowed by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: many were delivered from evil ſpirits by the third. They have a mind to perſwade us without any good reaſon, that theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, with all Relicks of an equivalent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, challenge religious veneration. No doubt, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was every way as valuable as his ſhadow; and yet when <hi>Cornelius</hi> made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to worſhip him, he prevented him by an expreſs prohibition. The Fathers in the ages next to the Apoſtles, were not ſuch good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as to make ſuch an advantagious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of theſe inſtances: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49823:51"/>we find them charging the Heathens with Superſtition of a like nature; as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Monuments of the Dead: and we never read, that the Heathens did retort upon them their guilt in the ſame kind, which, no doubt, they would have done, in caſe there had been any ſuch practice among them. <hi>Celſus, Lucian, &amp;c.</hi> were not ſo dull as to overlook ſo ſignal an advantage. They which uſe to charge them with too much, would have paid them their own, in caſe there had been the leaſt appearance of reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>As the moſt early Writers next to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles never mention the Worſhipping any elſe but God: ſo all the words, which import Divine Worſhip, are by them excluſively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him, <gap reason="foreign">

This practice doth evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they are conſcious, that their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cannot ſtand without this Principle be taken out of the way. The ſence of it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them in many particulars; as the Worſhip of the Sacrament, the Invocation of Saints, the Adoration of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Worſhip of the Sacrament. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath given too much occaſion to believe, that the Accidents of the Bread and Wine, are to be honoured with ſupreme
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49823:52"/>Veneration. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in plain words aſſerts, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, (which is granted to ſignifie ſupreme honours) is to be given to the Sacrament. It does not ſay to a part only of it; but uſeth the Word in general, which muſt neceſſarily imply the whole: and extend to all, which is appointed to be received. Now it is evident, that the Accidents are a part of the Sacrament, which is to be received. They conſtitute the outward and viſible ſign.<note place="margin">L. <hi>4.</hi> Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> repreſents them as the principal; <hi>ratio Sacramenti magis convenit ſpeciebus, ut conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Corpus, quàm corpori Chriſti, ut eſt ſub ſpeciebus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The following words of the Council confirm this Interpretation, <hi>nec enim minùs adoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, &amp;c.</hi> neither is it (the Sacrament) to be leſs adored; becauſe it hath been inſtituted by Chriſt the Lord that it may be taken: for him the ſame God we believe to be preſent in it, whom the eternal Father bringing into the World, ſaith, <hi>Let all the Angels adore him, &amp;c.</hi> Here the Sacrament is repreſented as that in which our bleſſed Lord is preſent and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, and by conſequence as diſtinct from it. That which contains any thing is always diverſe from that which is contained in it. Now what is there left for the Word Sacrament to import but the outward Elements, the ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part, under which it is ſuppoſed, that the Sacred Body of our bleſſed Lord is <hi>latent.</hi> His Preſence in the Sacrament is alledged as the reaſon of the Adoration given to it. Tho' this is not ſufficient to juſtifie the practice: (for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49823:53"/>then every thing, in which God is preſent, would be an adorable object, as the Sun and Moon, and whole Creation.) yet it leads us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meaning of the Word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as it lies in the Council, and aſſures us, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſome thing beſides our bleſſed Saviour, which can be nothing but the outward Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby he is repreſented. A command to give civil honour to the Throne of a Prince, becauſe the Prince himſelf ſits in it, evidently implies, that the Throne and the Prince are diſtinct one from the other.</p>
               <p>To expound the Decree by the Canon, in which there is mention only of Worſhipping Chriſt in the Sacrament, is very prepoſterous. They aim at two diſtinct things. The firſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to Worſhip the Sacrament: the ſecond, to Worſhip Chriſt, who is preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe two are as different, as to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Palace, in which the Prince reſides, and to Worſhip the Prince reſiding in that Palace.</p>
               <p>To ſay that no Catholick is bound to believe more than that Chriſt in the Sacrament is to be Worſhipped; becauſe this is enjoyned under a particular <hi>Anathema:</hi> the other of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Sacrament not, is nothing to the purpoſe. The intent of the Decrees is, <hi>verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m dicere,</hi> to ſet forth the true doctrin of the Church, as the Council has declared. Every jot of this doctrin is to be received, whether there be a particular Curſe denounced againſt the Refuſers of it, or no. The Curſe doth not make the obligation to comply with the doctrin; but ſhews only the danger which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49823:53"/>thoſe incur, who refuſe it. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not think fit always to ſet before us the danger in a particular <hi>Anathema,</hi> upon ſome prudential conſiderations beſt known to her ſelf; yet the obligation to entertain her doctrin doth not ceaſe, but remain in full force. Her Authority is as much in a Decree without an <hi>Anathema,</hi> as in a Canon with one: and it is her authority which creates the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>To ſay that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the Council ſpeaks of, falls upon the Accidents of the Bread and Wine in an inferiour manner, cannot be reconciled with any good reaſon. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is either internal or external. Internal imports a ſuperlative eſteem in the mind of infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. External, the doing ſome action or ſpeaking ſuch words, as are appropriated to ſignifie this internal veneration. Neither of theſe can be terminated upon the Bread and Wine in an inferiour manner. For what is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly done or ſpoken, being but an expreſſion or indication of internal veneration; and the inward veneration being of the higheſt nature, if it falleth upon any thing in an inferiour manner or degree, it ceaſeth to be what it was: the ſuperlative degree being eſſential to it, and not ſeparable from it.</p>
               <p>Neither do they mend the matter, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that <hi>Latria,</hi> as it is terminated upon the outward Elements is not abſolute, but relative: Chriſt only under the Elements is adored <hi>per ſe,</hi> or abſolutely: the Symbols by virtue of their relation to Chriſt; as the garments with
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49823:54"/>which he was cloathed, when he was upon the Earth, were worſhipped, when adoration was given to his perſon.</p>
               <p>When the Council ſays, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is due to the Sacrament, abſolute, and not relative <hi>Latria</hi> is intended. It is in expreſs words, ſuch a <hi>Latria quae debetur vero Deo,</hi> and that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly abſolute. Tho' there may be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive honour, yet (if we ſpeak properly) there can be no ſuch thing, as relative <hi>Latria.</hi> For it is agreed, that the word ſignifies that Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is peculiar to the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and if this be divided into two ſpecies Abſolute, and Relative, then it may be predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of both: for every Genus is predicated of its ſpecies: and if ſo, then either equally or unequally: not equally, for then the relative ſpecies will participate as much of the nature of the Genus, as the abſolute: not unequally, becauſe <hi>Latria</hi> (as I have before intimated) conſiſts in a point, of which there can be no unequal participations. An inferiour <hi>Latria</hi> is as much as an inferiour Superiority. I grant an honour due to many things upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their relation to God; but to make this honour equal to that, which is due imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to God, is highly injurious. For the relation which the Creature has to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is but a finite mode or accident. And a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mode cannot merit the ſame ſpecies of Worſhip or Honour, which the infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Divine Nature does.</p>
               <p>When our bleſſed Lord was upon the Earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> garments were not worſhipped by the ſame
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49823:54"/>individual act, with which his perſon was. For Worſhip is an acknowledgment of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: and none will aſſert, that the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of excellency can without a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable injury be terminated upon his Perſon, and his Garment.</p>
               <p>As the Accidents are worſhipped, ſo likewiſe is the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, that by the Prieſt's pronouncing the words of Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Body and Blood of Chriſt become cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally preſent upon the Altar: that by the ſame words, in the ſame moment, the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine is changed into them: that what the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine is converted into, muſt have the ſame worſhip terminated upon it, which is peculiar to the perſon of Chriſt, God-man. Now if there be no ſuch change, as is pretended, but the Bread and Wine retain their priſtine nature: it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the ſubſtance of the Bread is Worſhipped in the place of Chriſt. If it be ſaid that this cannot with juſtice be charged upon a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> becauſe he believes that the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine do not remain, and we muſt not impute the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of that to him, which he believes not to be in the Sacrament. I anſwer, that tho' this excuſe, at the firſt ſight, may appear plauſible: yet upon a due examination it will be found to be of no validity. By the ſame method of Reaſoning it may be concluded that a <hi>Jew</hi> reflects no diſhonour upon the True <hi>Meſſias,</hi> when in the Synagogue thrice a day,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49823:55"/>he curſeth <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> is not the True <hi>Meſſias:</hi> or that the <hi>Perſians</hi> do not Worſhip a creature, when they make their religious Addreſſes to the Sun; becauſe they apprehend, he is the firſt Being, and maker of all things: or that the Heathens did not ſacrifice to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as they are accuſed in the holy Scripture; becauſe they were far from believing, that their Idols were animated by infernal Spirits.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that an error ſpringing from the nature of the object, may contribute ſomething to an excuſe. Suppoſe there had been a Man, when our bleſſed Lord was upon the Earth, every way like him in the features of his face, and all the lineaments of his Body, and another induced by that ſimilitude, had given to him the veneration which is due only to Jeſus Chriſt: it had been tolerable in him, to have pleaded his error, it deriving its original from that which it was not in his power to help. But wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the error ſprings from a voluntary diſtemper in the Subject, it can have no propitious influence upon his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And this we have too much reaſon to believe is the caſe of thoſe, who adhere to the Community of <hi>Rome,</hi> who when they aſſert the Body of Chriſt to be corporally preſent in the Euchariſt, and the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine not, put the higheſt affront upon thoſe Topicks, from which we uſually derive our aſſurance in all other points of Divinity, namely the Scripture, Antiquity, Reaſon, Sence.</p>

               <p>We have not only the Words to juſtifie our interpretation, but the ſcope aimed at by him that ſpoke them. It is agreed on all ſides, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49823:56"/>God did deſign by them the inſtitution of a Sacrament. It is as unanimouſly aſſerted, that in every Sacrament there muſt be a viſible Sign, and a Thing ſignified. There is nothing here to import the outward Sign, but the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative, <hi>This:</hi> or the Thing ſignified, but that which is predicated of it, <hi>my Body.</hi> Now the ſign is never eſſentially, but always figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thing which is ſignified by it.

               <p>In the other part of the Sacrament, it is ſaid, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament.</hi> This cannot be true, eſſentially, as tho' the Cup was changed into the nature of the New Teſtament: but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively only. We have juſt reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſame concerning the Words under debate; that the Bread is no otherwiſe the Body of Chriſt, than the Cup is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. When this manner of Speech is uſed in relation to other Sacraments, as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the Paſſover; Circumciſion is my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Lamb is the Lord's Paſſover, it conſtantly bears this ſence. Neither Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or the Lamb were really and eſſentially the things which are predicated of them, but ſigns and memorials only.</p>
               <p>The admitting a Trope in the Words is not contrary to the deſign of Chriſt in his laſt Will, which undoubtedly was to deliver his mind clearly. We may ſpeak as plainly, when we uſe a Trope or Figure, as when our ſpeech is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49823:56"/>without it. If we walk in a Gallery adorned with Pictures, and ſay this is <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> this is <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, we are as well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if we had ſaid, this is the Picture of ſuch a Perſon. That is not obſcure whether figuratively or literally ſpoken, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed according to the manner, which is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to thoſe, to whom the words are directed. The known cuſtom at the time, when theſe words, [This is my Body] were uſed, was to ſpeak after the like manner about the Paſſover, into whoſe place the Sacrament of the Supper came. It was the uſual language of the <hi>Jews</hi> to call the Lamb the Body of the Paſſover. The Lamb being a Figure of Chriſt our Paſſover, and he putting a period to the old Inſtitution, and ſubſtituting Bread in the room of it, to be a memorial, and Type of himſelf under the Goſpel, he calls it by the ſame name. As the Paſchal Lamb had been his Typical Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament: So now he declares, that the Bread ſhall be his figurative Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New.</p>
               <p>If a Trope makes the Words obſcure, and unfit to be a branch of the laſt Will of Jeſus Chriſt, then the interpretation of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is condemned by her own acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For ſhe believes, that when it is ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> a living Body is meant: and therefore Body by a Synecdoche is put for the Body and Soul.</p>
               <p>The other part of the Sacrament is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his laſt Will as well as this: and yet in the words which ſet it forth, there is no leſs
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49823:57"/>than two Tropes. This Cup is the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my Blood. The Cup is put for the Wine contained in it: and the New Teſtament for the Sacrament of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p>As the ſcope of our Saviour confirms the ſence, which we have given: So likewiſe do the antecedents and conſequences. Before theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> were ſpoken, it is ſaid, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed and brake it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what can he mean by <hi>This,</hi> but that which he took into his hand and bleſſed and brake? and that is expreſly called Bread. After Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that which is termed his Blood is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Fruit of the Vine: ſo that, which he named his Body, is by his Spirit in the holy Apoſtle ſaid to be Bread. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat of this bread,</hi> v. 27. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread,</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p>If before and after Conſecration that which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>This</hi> doth import, is called Bread, then no ſuch mutation is made as is contended for, and the words muſt be interpreted in a Sacramental and Figurative Sence.</p>
               <p>We have not only the Antecedents and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences to favour our interpretation, but likewiſe the Analogy of Faith. This ſays, that Chriſt as man was made like unto his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. This car not be true, if he be corporally in the Sacrament. The bodies of his Brethren are naturally confined to a certain place. But according to this apprehenſion his Body may be in a thouſand places at once, even upon all the Altars in the World. Whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49823:57"/>the Hoſt is conſecrated, it is wholly in the whole, and wholly in every part of it.</p>
               <p>The Analogy of Faith aſſerts; that Chriſt it gone to heaven in his bodily preſence. <hi>I am no more in the world, Jo.</hi> 17.11. The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives of the words under debate, makes him to be more in the World, than when he converſed with his Diſciples upon the Earth. For then he was but in one place at a time: but now, according to the Creed of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> he is the ſame moment, in Millions of places.</p>
               <p>The Analogy of Faith aſſures us, that the body or flaſh of Chriſt ſhall ſee no corruption, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.27, 31. But if it be in the Sacrament, then it is corporally eaten, turned into Chyle, and Nutriment, and ſubject to all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the ingredients of a humane body are expoſed unto. To what is received in the Euchariſt, the primitive Church in relation to the body attributes the power of Nutrition.</p>
               <p>The Analogy of Faith obligeth us to believe, that God will not command inhumanity. But if the ſence of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be true, the greateſt inhumanity is practiſed according to his Will. What is more ſavage, than to eat the body of a living man? much more muſt it be to champ with our Teeth, and ſwallow down the living Body of our bleſſed Lord, to whom ſupreme Veneration is due. This made a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſay, Who doſt thou think,<note place="margin">Cott. in Cicer. de nat. Decr. l. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> can be ſo mad as to believe that to be his God, which he eats? It was an abomination to the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to eat with the <hi>Hebrews, Gen.</hi> 43.32. The
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49823:58"/>
                  <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſt gives the reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Hebrews</hi> eat thoſe Cattle which the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> uſe to worſhip. Thoſe words, <hi>except ye eat the fleſh of the ſon of man, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 6.55. give no countenance to what is aſſerted by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> By Fleſh is meant the bread ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 51. <hi>The bread that I will give you is my fleſh:</hi> and by the Bread we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our bleſſed Lord himſelf, <hi>I am the bread of life, v.</hi> 35. and by <hi>eating</hi> believing on him: as is evident by the conſequent words, <hi>he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> As eating and drinking ſatisfie our natural appetite: ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt our ſpiritual.

His policy ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that of a great Commander. When he had drawn up his Souldiers into a military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and was ready to engage the enemy, a great part of them declared, they would not fight. He being not in a capacity to retreat with honour or ſecurity, told them, that the only kindneſs which he deſired of them, was to march to a Hill a little way of, and there be Spectators of the courage and fate of their fellow Souldiers; hoping they might appear to the enemy as a Reſerve, and prove as great a diſcouragement to them, as if they had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engaged them. I cannot imagine, why theſe antient Fathers, who have ſo poſitively declared in the Teſtimonies above-cited, that they will not fight, ſhould be continued in view: except it be with the like deſign to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Faith of thoſe, who are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their intentions.</p>
               <p>To the Authorities, already produced, I might add many more, which do evidently manifeſt that the Church was a ſtranger to the doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation for many hundred years. What might be alledged, I will ſum up in the following particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. They all agree in an imitation of the ſtile of Scripture, and call the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſay, that they are not ſo eſſentially, but figuratively, and therefore ſtile them ſigns, Symbols, Figures, Antitypes, Memorials. It
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49823:60"/>is uſual to call the ſign and the thing ſignified by the ſame name.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They affirm that after Conſecration, the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine remains; and the change made is only in reſpect of Uſe, Office, and Dignity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſay, That they nouriſh our fleſh and blood, and have the ſame effect that other food has: and therefore they uſe to give the remains of the Euchariſcical Bread to boyes, and to abſtain from the Communion upon Faſting days.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They aſſert, that wicked men do not eat and drink the Body and Blood of Chriſt: but interpret the eating of his fleſh, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. the receiving of him in a ſpiritual manner, namely, by Faith.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When they deny the Euchariſt to be a figure or ſign, they mean a bare ſign. The Sacrament is more than ſo. It feals and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. It is a means, whereby we receive the Body and Blood of Chriſt, not only the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of them, but Chriſt himſelf, in a ſpiritual manner as crucified for us, and is a real pledge to aſſure us thereof. Tho' the crucified body of Chriſt is in Heaven, yet that ſpirit which dwells in it, being communicated to a worthy Receiver in the Sacramental action (we are made to drink into one Spirit) it produceth ſuch a union betwixt us and Chriſt Jeſus, as laies a clear foundation of Communion with, and participation of him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When they ſay, there is a mutation in the nature of the Bread, they mean by nature
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49823:60"/>the uſe and property only, as is manifeſt by their own explications. Before Conſecration it was appropriated to the nouriſhment of the body: but now by Conſecration it is exalted to a higher purpoſe. A new dignity is put upon it. It becomes a means, whereby a worthy Communicant gains Communion with our bleſſed Lord.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When it's ſaid, That the Senſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and no competent judges of the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this may be very true, altho' the change be Sacramental only. The change is not the proper object of ſenſe, but of faith. The knowledge of it, with its effects is conveyed to us by a Divine Teſtimony extant in the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="9">9. When it is affirmed, That under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread is given the Body, and under the ſpecies of Wine the Blood; by Species, we muſt not underſtand the Accidents without their proper ſubjects. This apprehenſion never entred into the thoughts of the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They were perfect ſtrangers to this kind of Philoſophy.<note place="margin">S.

               <p n="10">10. Where it is ſaid, That the Lord who changed Water into Wine, could change in the Euchariſt Wine into Blood, the intention of <hi>Cyril</hi> is not to make theſe two converſions in every thing parallel,<note place="margin">Jeruſ.</note> as is manifeſt by the words that follow; he preſently aſſerts, That
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49823:61"/>the eating of Chriſt's fleſh muſt be underſtood ſpiritually, and calls the Table myſtical and intellectual. And therefore all that his words can import is this: He who <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Laſtly, It muſt be acknowledged, that there are many Hyperbolical expreſſions in the Fathers,<note place="margin">Hom <hi>23.</hi> in Mat Par. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>If the defenders of Tranſubſtantiation did believe Antiquity to be favourable to them, what is the reaſon, why they uſe ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to keep us from the knowledg of it?

It is at laſt come to light, tho' very imperfect and mutilated. If our Adverſaries did know Antiquity to be propitious to them in this and other points of controverſie, they would not uſe ſo much colluſion as they do.

They have men which can counterfeit any hand, and write the old hand 500. or 1000. years ago. Then they have artificial Ink, which within three days after the writing looks as if it had been written 500. years afore. Thus having altered and taken out all that makes for us, they ſuppreſs all the true Copies, and produce the new ones (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written by themſelves as before) as the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49823:63"/>Authentick Books.</q> All this will manifeſt, that what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſerts concerning the Preſence of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, is contrary to Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reaſon. If the Bread be converted into the Body of Chriſt, let us ſuppoſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to be made in two places, at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Body of Chriſt in one of theſe places to ſtand upon the Altar, and in the other to be carried in Proceſſion. According to this Hypotheſis, the ſame individual body is moved, and not moved at the ſame time: God, whoſe concourſe is requiſite to all moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, concurs and not concurs. His Will which is the ſpring of all concourſe, conſents to the motion and not conſents. His Intellect, which has a knowledge of what he wills, knows and not knows the ſame individual: and all this at the ſame time. In a word, God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as making at the ſame inſtant two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary declarations. Thoſe who maintain the converſion under debate, ſay, That the Eſſences of things do not fall immediately under the notice of Sence; and the only way, which the Author of Nature has provided for us to come to the knowledge of them, is by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal modes, and accidents. If God declares in the Scripture, that what is in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after Conſecration is not bread, and yet ſuffers at the ſame time all the accidents to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, which he has appointed to declare, that it is Bread; he makes two declarations the ſame moment diametrically oppoſite one to the other. Such contradictions are not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49823:63"/>to his Nature. It is deſtructive of his Veracity to ſpeak two things contrary to each other, the ſame inſtant, in relation to the ſame matter. Indeed it is ſaid, That reaſon is not to be admitted to this debate, there being a clear revelation on the contrary ſide. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Myſtery of the Trinity is without heſitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy believed, altho' equal exceptions from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lye againſt it. To which I reply; that there is no revelation of any ſuch mutation in the Bread, as is contended for. Thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> import no ſuch matter, as I have before demonſtrated. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls, what remains after Conſecration in the Sacrament, by the name of bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. and we cannot have a better Interpreter of the mind of Chriſt, than he is. The Revelation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended cannot be true in any ſence, which is contradictory to reaſon. Tho' many things, before their manifeſtation, are beyond the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovery of Reaſon. Tho' after a diſcloſure is made, it is not in the power of reaſon to dive to the bottom of them: yet they are never contradictory to it. Reaſon and Revelation differ but as a leſſer and greater light. The underſtanding which is the Candle of the Lord, is no more oppoſite to Revelation, than the Lights, which are known by that name to the Celeſtial Luminaries with which the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament is adorned. Tho' reaſon be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the ſacred myſtery of the Trinity to judge what is contradictory; yet it may in the preſent caſe. There the object is infinite, and far above the comprehenſion of our narrow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49823:64"/>but here ſinite, and every way fit and proportionable to them. In the Euchariſt we are converſant about a finite Body, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which is very agreeable to our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: In the Trinity about an infinite and incomprehenſible Being. Reaſon is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gift of God. This gift is beſtowed for ſome purpoſe. The apparent deſign of it is to diſcern the true nature of thoſe objects which lie within its ſphere. In this number we muſt neceſſarily reckon, what appears in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it being ſo far from exceeding the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of our intellect; that it falls under the notice of Senſe. If Reaſon in this caſe may not he permitted to judg what is contradictory, the deſign in giving of it will be totally fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, and no certainty attainable in the moſt obvious matter. Thus it is evident, that Tranſubſtantiation is contradictory to Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Senſe. Our bleſſed Lord has manifeſted, that it is a competent judg in the preſent caſe by appealing to it concerning the reality of his Body, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. <hi>Jo.</hi> 20.27. What appears in the Sacrament has all the conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to qualifie it for ſenſation. The parts of it are big enough to move the Nerves. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the object is very ſuitable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. The ſpace, thro' which the Species paſs, is clear and perſpicuous. If Senſe, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed, may not be truſted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> certainty of all things will fail. There can be no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Courts of Juſtice ſufficient to ground a condemnatory Sentence upon. Eye-witneſſes, tho' of the greateſt integrity, will be of no
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49823:64"/>ſignification, all will be left in a perfect ſtate of Scepticiſm. The grand pillars which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Religion, will be utterly overthrown and demoliſhed. How can we be aſſured that there is a God, but by his Word and Works? And how can we perceive the Contents of his Word, or be acquainted with his Works, without uſing our Senſes? We cannot be ſure that <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God,</hi> or that this Propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> is contained in the New Teſtament, if we may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in our eyes. Miracles, the great Seals of Evangelical Verity, are rendered inſignificant; if the Senſes of thoſe who were preſent, when they were wrought, may not be truſted to, their atteſtation will be of no value.</p>
               <p>Indeed we are told, that the Senſe is not deceived in the Sacrament. The accidents of the Bread and Wine are its proper objects, and they remain there, according as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: but as for the Subſtance, that is mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly changed, and Senſe is no competent Judg about it. To which the reply is eaſie. Accidents alone are not the proper objects of Senſe: but Accidents, together with thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſubjects, in which they inhere. It is matter, which properly makes the impreſſion upon our Nerves; the Particles of it are under diverſe modes and figures commonly ſtiled Accidents. The Eſſence of theſe conſiſts in inheſion. <hi>Accidentis eſſe, eſt ineſſe:</hi> So that if they be ſeparated, they preſently ceaſe to be, and by conſequence have no power to make any impulſe upon Senſe. They can have
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49823:65"/>no more a ſolitary exiſtence, than the height, breadth and length of a houſe, with all the colours and modes of every room, may remain after the whole fabrick is demoliſhed. If there be any miraculous change in the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine, nothing can be more ſit to diſcern it than our Senſes. The eſſential effect of a Miracle is to work wonder and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and nothing can produce this, but that which is manifeſt to our faculties. Tho' the mode of doing is latent: yet the thing done is clear, and accommodated to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every Spectator.</p>
               <p>Theſe four Topicks, Scripture, Antiquity, Reaſon, Senſe, ſtanding in an irreconcileable oppoſition to the doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, nothing is left to ſupport it, except theſe two pretences, the Declaration of the preſent Church, and an impoſſibility that what ſhe declares ſhould be an Innovation.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt: If by the Church we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Univerſal, no ſuch thing is done by her. The Eaſtern Churches declare the contrary. The <hi>Greeks</hi> in their Liturgies have nothing of this nature expreſſed. They adhere to the ſeven firſt General Councils only, which are wholly ſilent in this matter. Tho' they have a proper word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to expreſs Tranſubſtantiation by, yet they never uſe it, when they ſpeak of the Euchariſt. When they call the Bread the Body of Chriſt, it is with an extenuating term, as <gap reason="foreign">

To ſay, notwithſtanding all this, that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation is the declared belief of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, is to cut off the <hi>Greeks</hi> from being any part of it, altho' they receive the Holy Scriptures, embrace the ancient Creeds, ſubmit to the ſeven firſt General Councils, have an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of Biſhops. If it be ſaid, That Schiſm and Hereſie has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them, and all other Churches of this priviledge and dignity, who do not ſubmit to the Papal Supremacy, this may be as eaſily denied as aſſerted. The Univerſality of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, contended for, is a perfect uſurpation, which can never be legitimated by length of time againſt the inſtitution of our bleſſed Lord, who conſtituted all the Apoſtles in a parity. No Man can with juſtice be charged with Schiſm or Hereſie for not owning of that, which bears an oppoſition to the appointment of the Supreme Head of the Church. If we muſt believe the declaration of the preſent Church in the point under conſideration, what were thoſe obliged to do, who lived in the time of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> when there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49823:66"/>diametrically oppoſite? The preſent Pope declares, That the Bread and Wine do not remain in the Sacrament. <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> a perſon of equal Authority, and every jot as Infallible, declares, That they do. Both theſe we cannot be obliged to believe, they being contrary one to the other. If the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be credited, whenſoever ſhe thinks ſit to declare her ſelf, How is this to be known? She has no peculiar promiſe made to her. That to the Univerſal is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe being but a part, and a very corrupt one too. All that the promiſe imports, is that there ſhall be always a people with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in the World, retaining all the points which are fundamental, and of peremptory neceſſity to Salvation, which may be, tho' the Community of <hi>Rome</hi> utterly ceaſe. As for any Univerſal Tradition about this matter, it is but a futilous and vain pretence; as is evident by the conteſts betwixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Biſhops. If the laſt had known of any ſuch Tradition, and believed the firſt to be infallible, a ſudden ſtop would have been put to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. No man will dare to oppoſe a Church, which he believes cannot err. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are there any motives of Infallibility effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious enough to induce us to receive this doctrin. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has reckoned up fifteen; but they are ſo far from evincing that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Infallible in her declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they will not amount to prove her a True Church, as will be manifeſt in the Fourth Section. As for the Second pretence,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49823:66"/>the impoſſibility of Innovation, it is in vain to alledge it againſt ſo much evidence as may be produced for the matter of fact. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church, for many Centuries, did aſſert, That the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine remains after Conſecration, as I have already proved. The doctrin of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, That it doth not remain. Here is an undeniable change: To ſet up an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry demonſtration againſt ſo clear a matter of fact, and to commend it to our belief with all the advantages of Art, is a method not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who, when he had received a fair fall by his Antagoniſt, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to impoſe upon his Spectators, with his Rhetorical flouriſhes, and perſwade them that no ſuch thing was done. Not only <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> (as I have before intimated) but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Sirmondus</hi> acknowledge, That Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation was not expoſed to a clear light before the Ninth Century. In the following Ages the profound ignorance of the people, and the ambition of the Prieſts gave a great advance to it. The Prieſts being deſirous of deference and reſpect from the people, knew no method more expedient to promote their purpoſe, than to adhere to that doctrin, which has a direct aſpect upon it. What could more readily commend them to the firſt place in the thoughts and opinion of the Vulgar, than to perſwade them, that they were ſo highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in Heaven, as from thence to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a power to turn Bread into the body of Chriſt? This, if ſincerely believed, muſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49823:67"/>inevitably be as efficacious to ſecure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an eternal veneration, as the doing the greateſt miracle recorded in the Sacred Oracles. After all the commotions about this doctrin, and the definition of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third in the Fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, the greateſt men for learning were at a loſs what to ſix upon. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Pariſienſis</hi> did afterwards publickly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That the Bread after Conſecration really remains, as the humane nature of Chriſt does, after its being advanced to the dignity of the Hypoſtatical Union. At the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> This buſineſs was brought to its perfection; yet, when the definition was to be made, the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans</hi> could not agree, but fell into warm conteſts; inſomuch, that at the laſt, the General Congregation did pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently reſolve to uſe as few words as poſſible, and to make an expreſſion ſo Univerſal as might be accommodated to the meaning of both parties. All this, (to which much more might be added) is ſufficient to aſſure us of the novity of Tranſubſtantiation, and to give us ſome light into the ſteps which it took, before it could arrive at the dignity of being an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we will give our ſelves leiſure to ſum up what has been ſpoken, we ſhall find too much reaſon to ſuſpect, that the error of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> about the Annihilation of the Bread and Wine, in the Sacrament, doth not ariſe from the nature of the Object, but a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſtemper in the Subject; and therefore can contribute little to an excuſe from the

               <p n="2">2. Invocation of Saints. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in this, do that which is highly injurious to the peculiar Honour of God. When they direct Mental Prayer to the Saints, the action in its own nature imports an acknowledgment; That they underſtand the Heart, which is a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge appropriated to the Supreme Being, in the Holy Scripture, <hi>Thou only knoweſt the hearts of the children of men,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 6.30. There is not a tittle in any part of Divine Revelation, whereby it appears, that God makes known our Hearts to them, but on the contrary, many clear intimations; That he reſerves this knowledge entirely to himſelf. When Vocal Prayer is made to them for Grace and Glory, it involves a confeſſion of a power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in them to confer that, which is the gift of God alone, thro' Jeſus Chriſt. If it be ſaid, That they are invocated not as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but Interceſſors for theſe things, they contradict the ſtile of their Devotion: <hi>O Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria gratioſa, dulcis, mitis, &amp; formoſa, applica nobis gratiam. O Maria glorioſa, in deliciis delicioſa, praepara nobis gloriam.</hi> In the <hi>Pſalter</hi> of the Virgin, all the Addreſſes made to God of whatſoever nature, are directed to Her. It is ſaid, That God the Father has done for Her, what <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> promiſed to <hi>Eſther,</hi> given one moiety of his Kingdom, namely, That of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49823:68"/>Mercy to Her, reſerving the other of Juſtice to himſelf. But let it be ſo, That one thing is ſpoken and another meant, (which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent at any time, much leſs in the Worſhip of God) and the Saints are prayed unto as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſors: yet this action cannot be excuſed from the blame of uſurping the Honour of the ſecond Perſon in the Sacred Trinity, who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the only Mediator betwixt God and Man. We know of no other in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: and it is not for mortal Man to appoint new Advocates in the Kingdom of Heaven, and make them Rivals with the great Maſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, who is of God's deſignation. An Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince looks upon it, as an inſufferable inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for Subjects, to appoint, who ſhall be his great Officers without his Order and Command.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, That the Saints are invocated, not as co-ordinate Interceſſors, but ſubordinate to Chriſt, this will not much mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For whether they be the firſt or laſt, yet it is plain, that when one particular Saint is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated the ſame hour and inſtant in diverſe places for things of a different nature, a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is ſuppoſed in that Saint to hear all their Petitions at once, and by conſequence to have an infinite Underſtanding. A Finite Intellect, tho' in the fruition of the greateſt advantages, either from the Revelation of God, or Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels, can underſtand but one object at a time. To have an actual apprehenſion of more than one at the ſame moment, is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity belonging to an unlimited and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite capacity.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49823:68"/>
               <p>If it be added, that the Senſe of the Church is, That we muſt have recourſe to the Prayers of the Saints departed, as we have to them, while they are living here; this will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to any reaſonable ſatisfaction. There is not the ſame reaſon for praying to Saints in Heaven, as there is for our deſiring our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren here to pray for us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are at a diſtance. Theſe are preſent. If a man reſiding in <hi>England</hi> ſhould fall upon his knees, and ſupplicate his friend in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> to aſſiſt him with his Prayers, the very Action in its own nature would import an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of an immenſity to him, which is peculiar to God. If he ſhould daily uſe his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to excite his devotion, and kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, make ſuch religious applications, as are uſually made to the glorified Saints before their Images: every one would look upon him as a perſon doing that, which is highly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Divine Honour. There is as much reaſon to believe, that the Saints on Earth may hear our Prayers at a diſtance, as the Saints in Heaven. There is not one Syllable in the Bible to aſſure us to the contrary. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham is ignorant of us, Iſa.</hi> 36. And if <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the Father of the Faithful is a ſtranger to our concerns, much more his Children, who are in his Boſom. God and Angels may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal our neceſſities to our friends in any place: yet no man looks upon this poſſibility as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to pray unto them, when they are at a diſtance from us. The Prayer, which our holy Religion requires, muſt be made in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49823:69"/>Faith, Faith muſt be grounded upon a Divine Teſtimony. There is no Teſtimony of this nature to aſſure us, that our Prayers made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, are known to glorified Spirits in Heaven. If there be any way, whereby they come to be acquainted with them: yet God has hid it from us, as he did the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> from the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to prevent the occaſion of an abuſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt to be the only Mediator for us in Heaven, to whom we are to make our applications. He is entered into the Holy of Holieſt, and there alone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to God our Incenſe, as the High Prieſt did here upon the Earth. Upon this account it is ſaid, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man, the man Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. The Mediator is here repreſented to be one as the Deity is one. As there is but one God, ſo there is but one Mediator for us to addreſs unto, in the ſtate of Glory. When he was about to leave the World, and enter into this Bleſſed State, he gave his Diſciples inſtructions to pray in his name only, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13.16.23. He does not mention the name of any of the Saints. As he was alone in the Work of his Meritorious Satisfaction: So He is alone in the application of it by his Gracious Interceſſion. Therefore the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles there be Gods many, and Lords many.</hi> They had their Sovereign Deities, and likewiſe their <hi>Baalims,</hi> or Lords which they accounted as Mediators betwixt them and thoſe Supreme Powers: but to us, who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49823:69"/>embrace the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>There is but one God, and one Lord Jeſus, Chriſt is the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for us in Heaven.</hi> This dignity he has purchaſed with the ineſtimable price of his blood. <hi>He humbled himſelf and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the death of the Croſs: Wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him, Phil.</hi> 2.8. He ſits at his right hand, appears in his preſence for us, and lives for ever to make interceſſion. As the price which he gave for this dignity could not be paid by any but himſelf; ſo the office procured by it muſt be incommunicable, and peculiar to him. And therefore for any to ſet up other Mediators, whether of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or Interceſſion, without a command from Heaven is an inexcuſable injury to his prerogative. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do not only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate Saints, that they may make a charitable Intereceſſion for them: but that by their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits they would procure the favours, they are Petitioners for.</p>
               <p>This Truth concerning one Mediator is ſo evident, that the primitive Chriſtians were unanimous in the reception of it. For three Hundred years no inſtance can be produced, out of any Authentick Record, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of any in Heaven beſide our bleſſed Lord, was made uſe of. Two are chiefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the contrary, and in both the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is concerned. In the firſt She is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as the Advocate of <hi>Eve;</hi> in the ſecond as invocated by <hi>Juſtina</hi> the Martyr. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> mentions the firſt, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 19. Where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the obedience of <hi>Eve</hi> to the word of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49823:70"/>Evil Angel, with the obedience of <hi>Mary,</hi> to the word of the Good. He aſſerts, that <hi>Eve</hi> was ſeduced; that ſhe might fall from God. <hi>Mary</hi> obedient, that ſhe might be the mother of our Lord. And adds this moreover as a further deſign of her obedience, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Virginis Evae virgo Maria ſteret Advocata.</hi> All this comes very ſhort of what is deſigned to be proved by it. <hi>Advocata</hi> here is no more than <hi>Conſolatrix.</hi> Becauſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Greek (in which language, it is believed, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> wrote) ſignifies both an Advocate and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter: therefore <hi>advocare</hi> in the Latin Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is uſed for <hi>conſolari,</hi> as appears, <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>Ego vos advocabo, &amp; in Hieruſalem advocabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini. I will comfort you, and ye ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in</hi> Jeruſalem. So that his meaning will amount to no more than this. As <hi>Eve</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeduced by the Evil Angel fell from God, and brought ſorrow, diſhonour, and death upon her Sex: So the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by being obedient to the word, which was ſpoken by the Good Angel, did make a full compenſation, and reſtore the Honour, that <hi>Eve</hi> and all her Sex were impaired in. This is the Conſolation, which ſhe is ſaid to receive from the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> If this had been conſidered by <hi>Feuar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi> he would not have drawn ſo perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory a concluſion as he has done.<note place="margin">Ann. in. Iren.</note> 
                  <hi>Hinc eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> From hence it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That the antient Fathers and Martyrs from the very times of the Apoſtles did Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49823:70"/>
               <p>The other inſtance concerning <hi>Juſtina</hi> is in <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> The ſtory is this, S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> before his converſion was inamoured with the beauty of <hi>Juſtina.</hi> In order to the obtaining his unchaſt deſires, he made uſe of Magick. She having a deep reſentment of her danger, prayed to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, <hi>Pontius</hi> the Deacon of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who wrote his Life at large, ſpeaks no ſuch matter: but on the contrary, That <hi>Cyprian</hi> before his Converſion was ſtudied in all good Arts, which tend to the utility of the Age: amongſt which Infernal Magick can have no place.</p>
               <p>Indeed there was a Book extant in <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi>'s time, ſtiled <hi>Poenitentia Cypriani,</hi> and now to be ſeen in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Edition of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in which <hi>Juſtina</hi> is mentioned: but it is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a fabulous relation, and was condemned under that notion by <hi>Gelaſius. Nazianzen</hi> from thence probably did borrow the ſum of what he has expreſſed. He uſing the freedom of an Orator, and not the exactneſs of an Hiſtorian, might be induced to make uſe of that, which he found made ready to his hand, without any ſtrict examination, and ſet it off with ſome Rhetorical Flouriſhes; amongſt which we may reckon the application of the Virgin <hi>Juſtina</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> In this he did accommodate himſelf to the inclination of the Age in which he lived, which by frequent Apoſtrophe's made to Martyr's by ſome great Men in their Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks, was diſpoſed to think favourably of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49823:71"/>ſuch Addreſſes. It is uſual for Writers, when they relate what was done in former Ages, to dreſs it up in language and circumſtances ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their own times. Of this we have an evident inſtance in <hi>Nazianzen</hi> himſelf, in his 22. <hi>Orat.</hi> Where he deſcribes the Martyrdom of the ſeven Brethren, and the deportment of their mother, 2 <hi>Macc.</hi> 7. He ſays, She ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the drops of blood, took the fragments of their members, worſhipped the remains. If we conſult the Author of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> and the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> where their ſufferings are deſcribed at large, no ſuch thing is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It cannot reaſonably be believed, That a Woman, who incouraged her children to die, rather than to violate the Law of God, ſhould at the ſame time openly break it, by touching the Dead, contrary to the <hi>Maſaical</hi> Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that the words of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> can be nothing but an Oratorical excurſion adapted to the circumſtances of his own Age, in which the remains of the Martyrs were held in great eſtimation, ſometimes expreſſed by ſuch ſort of Actions, as he attributes to the Mother of the ſeven Brethren; tho' nothing was intended which did exceed a civil deference and reſpect.</p>
               <p>The Invocation of Saints by degrees did creep into the Church. The Firſt ſtep was a belief, That the Saints departed did freely, without any asking, implore the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the behalf of thoſe which were left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, without any apprehenſion of a duty incumbent on them to addreſs their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to them. The Second was the practice of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49823:71"/>ſome, who, when the Martyrs were going out of the World, did before their departure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them, to remember them in Heaven. The Third was occaſioned by the Rhetorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſome in the Fourth Age, who in their Panegyrical Orations made Apoſtrophe's to the Saints departed, in order to the moving the Paſſions of their Auditors: but withal did often inſert ſuch words, as plainly intimate, they had no aſſurance they were heard by them: So that all that can be made of them, are rather Oratorical Wiſhes, than proper Invocations.</p>
               <p>When theſe Flowers of Rhetorick were tranſplanted into the minds of the Vulgar, the badneſs of the Soil, made them to degenerate into Weeds. They not rightly underſtanding the meaning of the Orators, did by their ill conſtruction encourage themſelves to pray to Saints in their private Devotions: which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is fully condemned by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius,</hi> and manifeſtly declared to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Superſtition of the People, and not the Doctrin of the Church. The publick Offices of the Church are the proper Standard, whereby we are to judge of the Worſhip of every Age: and none ſuch are found ſo early, in which Prayer is directed to Saints in a ſtate of ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to the laſt particular, which is plainly injurious to the divine Honour, namely, the uſing of Images in the Worſhip of God. Thoſe, who are concerned in this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, may be reduced to Three ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:49823:72"/>1. Such as pretend, they give no Worſhip to Images: but uſe them as memorials to quicken their Devotion and excite in them the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what they repreſent. Theſe do that which has no propitious influence upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It will be difficult for them to kindle the fire of their Devotion at an Image: and yet ſo to order the matter, that no ſparks ſhall light upon the Image it ſelf. It is not eaſie to conceive, how they ſhould kneel, pray, burn incenſe before Images, and yet give no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous honour to them. This is contrary to the <hi>Catheciſme ad Parochos, p.</hi> 321. and the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which ſay, That due honour and veneration is to be given to them.</p>
               <p>Material repreſentations of the Deity, tho' not intended for exact ſimilitudes, are very apt to indiſpoſe the mind, and produce apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions very diſagreeable to the nature of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite Spirit. Tho' they are ſaid to be Books adapted to the infirmity of the Vulgar, and very fit to inſtruct them: yet in the ſacred O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles they are repreſented as holding forth a doctrin of vanities, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.8. and as teachers of lies, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.18. They leſſen reverential fear, and impreſs incongruous notions upon the mind. The miſchief from them is greater than any good, that can reaſonably be expected by them. When Books are more apt to lead us into errour, than acquaint us with truth, it is better to lay them aſide, than to uſe them. The humane nature of Chriſt in glory, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect, cannot be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in colours by the moſt curious Artiſt.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49823:72"/>A blind man may as well draw a picture, as thoſe, who have not ſeen them, make a true delineation of them. The Images, which are uſed, are as injurious to them, as a deformed picture would be to the greateſt beauty. The hurt, which they do to the Underſtanding by impreſſing falſe Idea's upon it, is much greater than any advantage that can accrue to the Will and Affections by them: That heat, which is in the Affection, is of ſmall moment, except it be produced by a true light in the Intellect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are others, which confeſs, they give Honour and Worſhip to the Image: but ſay it is inferiour to that which they give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. Now theſe ought to declare, whether this inferiour Worſhip be Religious, or Civil only. If Civil, namely ſuch a value, as a man has for the memorial of his friend, this nothing concerns the matter under debate; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute being wholly about Religious Worſhip, which ultimately terminates in God. If it be Religious, it is to be inquired, whether it ſtays in the Image, or only paſſeth thro' it to the Prototype. If the firſt, then God is not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by the Image, which is ſuppoſed in this diſcourſe: for the Worſhip ends in the Image. If the ſecond, a Worſhip is given to him inferiour to that which is due: and ſo a double fault is committed. Too much is given to the Image, and too little to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are thoſe, who profeſs to give the ſame honour to an Image which is due to the Prototype. They ſay, That the Saints and their Images are to be honoured with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49823:73"/>Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and her Image with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. God and his Image with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. When it is urged, That the Image of God is but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore not to be joyned with him in the ſame kind of Worſhip: They endeavour to ſecure themſelves againſt this inconvenience, by taking Sanctuary under ſome nice diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: They ſay that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> given to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is not terminative, but relative, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute but reſpective, ſuch as is given to the Commiſſioner of a Prince It doth not ſtay in him, but redounds to the honour of his Maſter. Tho' it is a fault to give the ſame abſolute ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God and his Image; yet there is no hurt in giving the ſame relativé.</p>
               <p>But this will not ſalve the matter. Abſolute Worſhip is that, which is given to an Image abſolutely conſidered: Relative, as it ſtands in relation to God. Now the relation which is the formal object of Worſhip, being but an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or finite mode inherent in the Image, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other foundation, but humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There is as much hurt in giving the ſame Worſhip which is due to God, unto the Image upon the account of this relation, as if it was abſolutely conſidered. The Image is a ſubſtance, the relation an accident appertaining to it. If it be an injury to God, to give his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Honour to a finite ſubſtance, which is of his own formation; it can be no leſs to give it to a mode which is nothing but the product of imagination.</p>
               <p>As for what is ſaid concerning the honour done to a Commiſſioner; it is true, it does not
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49823:73"/>ſtay in him, but redounds upon the Prince, whoſe character he bears, provided, that it keeps its proper bounds, and has none of thoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities blended with it, which are peculiar to the Sovereignty. If Subjects ſhould put a Crown upon the head of a Commiſſioner, and inſtal him in the Throne with all the rites and ceremonies which are annexed to the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and call it, not terminative, but relative Honour; the Prince would have more cauſe to ſuſpect Treaſon was deſigned againſt him, than believe any honour accrues to him by ſuch actions. The Gods on Earth are ſo far like him, who is higher than the higheſt, that they have their <hi>Regalia,</hi> which are incommunicable. If they ſhould ſo far forget themſelves, as to be willing to part with them, yet God cannot with his; not becauſe his Power is leſs, but his Sovereignty greater. They are Sovereigns by poſitive inſtitution only. His Sovereignty is eſſential and immutable. He can no more allow the derivation of his peculiar Honour to another, than he can deny himſelf. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of his eſſence will not permit him to do that which is intrinſecally evil. So long as the honour done to a creature, which is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to repreſent him, has no mixture of the peculiarities which belong to the Celeſtial Crown, it doth redound upon him, it being an act of obedience to his Will: but in caſe it has, it degenerates into a palpable injury to the rights of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Upon this account relative Worſhip is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Scripture under the notion of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49823:74"/>Idolatry. Three ſorts of Idolaters it acquaints us with. Either ſuch as totally renounce the True God and his Law, and go after other Gods to ſerve them; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 5. Or elſe ſuch as retain the fear and worſhip of the True God, and joyn ſtrange Gods with him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.33. Or laſtly, thoſe who profeſs to Worſhip only the True God, but do it by external Symbols and repreſentations. This is nothing but relative Worſhip: and yet by the Penmen of the Sacred Oracles, it is accounted Idolatry: as is manifeſt in the Calf which <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> made, which was deſigned for a Symbol of the preſence of the True God. Whether it was erected in imitation of the Cherub, which <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> a little before had ſeen in the Mount, or of the golden Bulls, the Symbols of <hi>Oſyris,</hi> is not much material. So much is certain, That, (whatſoever was the reaſon of forming of it into this ſhape) none but the True God was intended to be repreſented by it. This will be evident, if we conſider the ground of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deſire. They were under an expectation, that in their travel in the Wilderneſs they ſhould have a vilible Symbol of the preſence of <hi>Jehova</hi> framed by <hi>Moſes.</hi> He being ſo long abſent in the Mount, that they were at a loſs in their thoughts, what was become of him, they deſired <hi>Aaron</hi> that he would act in his ſtead, and do it for them. Here is no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to change the True God, with whom they lately entred into Covenant: but only to have a Symbol of his preſence in the midſt of thoſe difficulties which the Deſert might expoſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49823:74"/>them to. Their own words demonſtrate this to be their meaning.

               <p>And now if we look back, and conſider, that thoſe, who uſe Images in Divine Worſhip, as memorials only, and inſtruments to excite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, do that which has a tendency to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon the mind Ideas, very diſagreeable and injurious to the nature of the Deity: that Thoſe who give an inferiour Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to them, deſigning by ſo doing to honour and worſhip God, give too much to them, and too little to God: that Thoſe who profeſs to give equal worſhip by what name ſoever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, whether terminative or relative, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49823:76"/>or reſpective, put the higheſt affront upon the Deity, whoſe infinite nature will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a finite Being to be joyned with him in the ſame act of Worſhip; we muſt be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the reaſon of the thing, that the uſing Images in the Worſhip of God is undeniably prejudicial to the Honour of Heaven. We have not only the reaſon of the thing, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command of God to guide us in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, which prohibits the worſhipping of him by Images. Let our intentions be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſincere, and our devotion ſcrewed up to the higheſt degree, yet we muſt neceſſarily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, when we are doing that which is contrary to his precept. If Subjects ſet up a perſon to repreſent their King, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his expreſs injunction, and pay to him the honour due to a real Repreſentative: The King will not think himſelf honoured by their act on, it being blended with an apparent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect to his Authority. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great gave a command, that none but <hi>Apelles</hi> ſhould draw his Picture: If any other had done it with the greateſt exactneſs, and an unfeigned deſire to honour him, the reſpect would not have redounded upon him, being utterly blaſted by an act of diſobedience to his order.</p>
               <p>That God has forbidden us to Worſhip him by Images is manifeſt by the Second Command, Where we are injoyned not to make any Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whether carved or plain, either of any thing in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Water under the Earth, in order to the bowing down to them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49823:76"/>and to the worſhipping and ſerving him by them. The Firſt obligeth us to Worſhip no other God but <hi>Jehova.</hi> The Second not to worſhip him (as the Heathens uſe to do their Deities) by addreſſing our Veneration to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Symbols and Repreſentations. This is plain from the explication of this Precept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>Take ye therefore good heed to your ſelves (for ye ſaw no manner of ſimilitude on the day, the Lord ſpake to you in Horeb out of the midſt of the fire) leſt you corrupt your ſelves and make you a graven image, the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of any figure, the likeneſs of male or female.</hi> No graven Image or ſimilitude in relation to the True God appeared in <hi>Horeb.</hi> Therefore, it is inferred, that none ought to be erected, in order to the worſhipping and giving honour to him.</p>
               <p>It is no prejudice to this Interpretation, that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Images, either relating to the Worſhip of <hi>Jehova,</hi> or the Heathen Deities, muſt be here prohibited in the Second Command. The laſt cannot be, becauſe this is ſufficiently done in the Firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me.</hi> For if we may not ſerve the Heathen Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, much leſs pay to their Images thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49823:77"/>regards, which the nature of a Deity doth challenge.</p>
               <p>Theſe Images comprehend not only the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of God, but of any creature whether in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, formed with a deſign to Worſhip God by them. The ſcope of the Precept, is to interdict the Worſhipping the True God, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the Heathens uſe to worſhip their Deities. They had two ſorts of <hi>Numens,</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and Inferiour. They thinking it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to make an immediate acceſs to the Firſt, made uſe of the mediation of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to procure their acceptance. The Images of theſe Mediators they worſhipped, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that Honour and Worſhip, by their ſo doing, would accrue to the Sovereign <hi>Numens,</hi> whoſe Miniſters they were believed to be. So that the Command forbidding the Worſhip of the True God after that mode, which the Heathens uſed in the Worſhip of their Deities, muſt comprehend the interdiction of all Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whether of God himſelf, or any Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which are ſuppoſed to intercede betwixt God and Men, provided that they be ſet up with an intention to be bowed down unto, and worſhipped, that thereby God may be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and Honoured.</p>
               <p>God likes not, that the Worſhip, which is peculiar to him, ſhould be ſtrained thro' an Image, before it comes to him: but declares, that he is jealous in that caſe, and will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49823:77"/>the intention of the Worſhipper may be.</p>
               <p>What is uſually pretended concerning the Cherubims in the holy of holieſt, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to Worſhip his footſtool, is not ſufficient to juſtifie the worſhipping External Repreſentations of him. The Cherubims over the Ark were not deſigned for objects of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. A Veil was interpoſed betwixt them and thoſe, who came into the Temple. They were not ſo much as permitted the ſight of them. When the High Prieſt once a year went into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> we never read he gave them any adoration. God promiſed to commune with him from betwixt the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. Which intimates, that his adoration was not terminated upon them, but the Supreme Being, who promiſed his ſpecial preſence in the ſpace betwixt them.</p>
               <p>There is no Command to worſhip his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>As the Second Command condemns the Worſhipping God by Images: ſo likewiſe do all thoſe who enjoyed the beſt advantages to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. The Ages next to the Apoſtles were perfect ſtrangers to this practice; as is evident by the ſilence of their Adverſaries in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts with them.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:49823:78"/>
               <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> who profeſſed an enmity to this kind of Worſhip, ever ſince the captivity, and were careful to publiſh any thing which tended to the defamation of Chriſtianity, never charge this crime upon the Primitive Profeſſors of it. Amongſt the errours objected againſt them in the conference with <hi>Tryphon,</hi> in the diſcourſe of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and many other diſputations, we never read of the Adoration of Images. The <hi>Miſhna,</hi> which is believed to be Written about Two Hundred years after Chriſt, is wholly ſilent in this matter, altho' the Compoſer had a convenient opportunity to ſpeak of it in his Treatiſe concerning ſtrange Worſhip. Their implacable enmity to the Laws of Chriſt, gives us the higheſt degree of aſſurance, that nothing could be the cauſe of their ſilence, but the innocence of the Chriſtians. In the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> which was finiſhed about the time that Images were brought into Churches, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Temple is ſtiled a Houſe of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The Heathens, when they were accuſed by the Chriſtians for worſhipping Idols, never mention, in their vindication of themſelves, the adoration of Images among Chriſtians: which certainly they would have done, in caſe there had been any ſuch practice.<note place="margin">Dall. de Imag.</note> When the Idols of the <hi>Americans</hi> were demoliſhed by the command of <hi>Alphonſus Suaſus,</hi> they ſent four men to complain of the injury, who acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that they did not expect ſuch uſage from Chriſtians, who gave Divine Honour to Images, and pointed to the Picture of <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> which hung in his chamber, and told him,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49823:78"/>That the ſame honour which he gave that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, they gave to their Idols. When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That Chriſtians did not worſhip ſuch Pictures upon their own account, but as they were repreſentations of glorified Perſons in Heaven: They anſwered, Neither did they their Idols for their own ſakes, but as they repreſented the Sun, Moon, and Stars.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Bernier</hi> told the <hi>Eaſt-Indians,</hi> That he was ſcandalized upon the account of their worſhipping Idols: he received a like anſwer from ſome of the chief of them.<note place="margin">Hiſt. of the Gent. of Indoſtan Vol. <hi>3.</hi> p. <hi>172.</hi>

They are in our Temples, becauſe it is neceſſary for praying well to have ſome thing before our eyes to ſix our mind: and when we pray, it is not the Statue we pray to, but he who is repreſented by it.

               <p>If theſe barbarous People were ſo quick as to make ſo appoſite a retort when they were

               <p>The Primitive Chriſtians in many places were ſo remote from the worſhipping Images, That they did not allow the making of them, as is plain by the words of <hi>Clemens</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi>

                  </note> In caſe they were made, they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to be brought into Churches. When <hi>Adrian</hi> gave command, That Temples ſhould be built without Pictures, it was taken for granted, that he intended them for the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt. When <hi>Epiphanius</hi> found in a Church a Veil with the Picture of a Man painted upon it, he preſently rent it in pieces, and defended his action, by alledging, that it was contrary to the Scripture, That the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Man ſhould be hanged up in the Church of Chriſt. When Images were brought into Churches, the worſhip of them was utterly diſallowed. <hi>Serenus</hi> was for the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out to prevent danger.<note place="margin">Greg.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> for the keeping them in, to inſtruct the illiterate. Both agree in this; That they are not to be adored. When <hi>Philippicus,</hi> (being tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an intemperate love to the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>) took down the Pictures of the firſt Six General Councils, and by this action provoked <hi>Rome</hi> to a greater meaſure of zeal for Images,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49823:79"/>than the adoration of them was thought upon. The hint that was expreſſed, gave an alarm to the Synod called by <hi>Conſtantius Copronymus,</hi> and occaſioned the making a decree; That, to give religious veneration to Images is nothing elſe, but to revive the Superſtition of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans. When the Council under <hi>Irene.</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcind this decree, it is obſervable, that it did prohibit the making the Picture of God. This impiety then had no Umbrage from Authority.</p>
               <p>If we conſult the Monuments of Antiquity, it will be apparent, That in the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Ages, there were hot diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the worſhip of Images: but no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance given to the making or worſhipping the Image of God. In the Three Ages immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, They are ſometimes mentioned as Ornaments of Churches, and inſtruments to teach the ignorant, but not as the Objects of Worſhip. In the Three firſt Centuries there is no mention of them at all in the concerns of Religion.</p>
               <p>The Reſemblance upon the Chalice, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of, was an Emblem of the Parable of the loſt Sheep, and not a Picture of Chriſt, or any particular Saint. It was not drawn with a deſign to be Worſhipped; but to ſignifie, That thoſe, who are gone aſtray, may, upon their repentance, be received into the Communion of the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſtory in <hi>Euſebius,</hi>

                  </note> concerning the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Chriſt, and the Woman cured by him of her iſſue of blood, is too dubious to lay a foundation for a clear teſtimony. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49823:80"/>aſſerts, That he ſaw two Statues of braſs at <hi>Caeſarea Philippi,</hi> but he doth not ſay, That they were the Statues of Chriſt and Woman; but that the people ſaid ſo. Nothing is more familiar, than for them to be miſtaken in their account of ſuch publick Monuments. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that ſuch famous teſtimonies of the Truth of Chriſtian Religion, ſhould remain in the open ſtreet untouched, for the ſpace of Three Hundred Years, amidſt the ſlames of the hotteſt perſecutions; when the greateſt privacy could not ſecure any thing appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Chriſtians, from the rage and fury of the Heathens. Suppoſe all this was ſo, yet the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will gain no advantage by it. For no Religious Addreſſes were made to theſe Statues. They were not in the Church but the ſtreet. Not erected to be Objects of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but Memorials of a Miracle. That which was reputed to be the Statue of Chriſt, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorgius</hi> aſſures us, had no adoration given to it; and adds his reaſon, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>All this, if duly pondered, will aſſure us; That there is no Commiſſion from God for I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage-Worſhip; but, on the contrary, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit prohibition.

To which we reply, That peculiar Worſhip is either internal or external. Tho' internal, which includes ſuch an apprehenſion, is not given to Images, yet external is, which conſiſts in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigns appropriated by Nature or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to import and ſignifie it. He is not only injurious to God, who alienates the whole, but he who exhibits any part of it to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He is accounted a Traitor, who pays part of the Tribute to another Prince, which is peculiar to his own. The <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> tho' they did not apprehend that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>'s Calves were inveſted with the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable perfections of the Deity: yet they are charged with Idolatry, upon the account of the external Worſhip, they gave to them. The <hi>Arrians</hi> lie under the ſame imputation in the Writings of the Fathers, becauſe they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped Chriſt, whom they believed not to be God. The Chriſtians in <hi>Julian</hi>'s time did think they had contracted the ſame guilt, when thro' fraud they were unwittingly induced to give external Honour to thoſe Idols, of which they had in their hearts a perfect abhorrence.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Who they are that lie under an obligation to Worſhip.</hi> Religion being a reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, thoſe who are concerned in it, muſt be endued with Reaſon and Underſtanding: and theſe are either Angels or Men.</p>
               <p>The Angels, Enjoying the favour of being admitted to the Beatifical Viſion, are under a willing neceſſity of being engaged in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt acts of Religion. The conſtant diſcloſures of the Divine Glory do command from them the moſt reverential regards. They are ſtiled Cherubims, to import, That they are always upon the Wing, prepared to execute the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Pleaſure: and Seraphim, to denote their Zeal in the diſcharge of their obligations. Their conformity to the great command of Love, we have an Apodictical Evidence of in their rejoycing at the Converſion of a Sinner,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49823:81"/>and the Renovation of the Divine Image in him. They are ſo abſolute in the performance of the Duties of Religion, that their Practice is propounded as the Pattern of our Obedience, <hi>Thy Will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</hi> When the Second Perſon in the Sacred Trinity was introduced into the World, that the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of humane Nature, with which he was cloathed, might be no temptation to them to make any abatement in their uſuall addreſſes, a ſpecial Command is given: <hi>Let all the Angels of God Worſhip him. Heb.</hi> 1.6.</p>
               <p>Men (Who are thoſe, whom we here inquire after,) are either Secular or Eccleſiaſtical. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, are not exempted from Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It is ſaid, That the Earth has a double motion, one about its own Axis, another about the Sun. Secular men muſt imitate the Earth, beſides their motion about their Earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, they muſt have another about their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial. The Lord who beſtows the World upon them, has reſerved a Rent to himſelf. Religion concerns every man, in whatſoever Function he is engaged. Particular Vocations, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s thin ears of Corn, muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the General. When any enter upon their Civil Imployments, they do not ceaſe to be Creatures inveſted with Reaſon: and ſo long as they continue in that capacity, they ly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an indiſpenſable obligation, to pay a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Homage to that Eternal Spirit, by whoſe Incubation they were formed. Neither do they ceaſe to have a paſſionate deſire for their own happineſs, and no man can enjoy
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49823:82"/>any meaſure of this, without a union with the Supreme Good; (the diſſatisfactions which often emerge, while we are in the embraces of theſe ſublunary fruitions, do openly proclaim them, not to be the ſeat of real Beatitude) and Union with the Supreme Good cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, except we with all integrity Serve and Worſhip God.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever our employment is, we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be Creatures of that Species towards whoſe redemption an infinite price has been depoſited, and therefore muſt remain under the ſtricteſt obligations to be Religious. This is the Apoſtles argument, <hi>Ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God.</hi> It is an hyperbole of ingratitude, not to be ingaged in theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have the moſt direct aſpect upon his honour, from whom ſo ſignal a benefit is received. No worldly concern can cancel our obligations to him, who has parted with his own Son, in order to the procurement of our Redemption from the greateſt Miſery and Vaſſalage.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God is the Fountain of all that Wiſdom, whereby any are fitted for their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. All from the Shovel to the Scepter, from the loweſt to the higheſt, are inſtructed by him. He teacheth Princes to Rule, and guides the Husbandman to manage the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Agriculture. Thoſe who have this dependence upon God, offend againſt the cleareſt dictate of Reaſon, if they refuſe to intermit their labour, that they be employed in the moſt ſolemn agnitions of him. The noiſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49823:82"/>in this ſublunary ſtate about ſecular matters, will make no harmony in the ear of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, except ſuch Reſts and Pauſes be intermingled with it. Upon this account the Apoſtle adviſeth, That every one abide in his Calling in which he is called with God. Let our Function require never ſo much of our attendance, yet God muſt not be excluded. Some time muſt be ſpared for the immediate acts of his Solemn Worſhip.</p>
               <p>As Secular Men are concerned in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Work: So likewiſe much more thoſe who are Eccleſiaſtical. I mean ſuch Perſons as are ſolemnly Ordained and Conſecrated to the performance of ſome Religious Offices. The neceſſity of them will be manifeſt, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that a part of that Service, which the Goſpel requires; in particular, the being an Embaſſadour to the Son of God, is a work of ſuch importance, that every capacity is not agreeable to it. It doth not become every one to ſtand in this relation to an Earthly Prince; much leſs to the Heavenly. Now men uſually are no competent Judges of their own ability. The generality are very partial in their reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon themſelves, are eaſily flattered into a belief, that the dominion of their Reaſon is as large as thoſe Monarchs have fancied their Territories, who by the ſtrength of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have entituled themſelves to the regency of the World, and expreſſed diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Coſmographers</hi> for not allowing them a bigger ſpace in their Tables. This unfitneſs in men to judg of themſelves, devolves a neceſſity upon
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49823:83"/>others to do it for them; otherwiſe the ends of the Miniſterial Function will be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by an intruſion of the unskilful, and confuſion take place of all good order. Thoſe who judge, muſt be perſons of Learning and experience in the ſame imployment. None can judge, but thoſe who are fit; and none have ſuch a degree of idoneity, as thoſe who are thus qualified. The buſineſs of a Spiritual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor is not only to lead his flock into advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious places to feed in it, but to defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rapine of Wolves; not only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, but convince gain-ſayers. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.9. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe who contend againſt the Truth, making uſe of their improvements in humane Studies for the accompliſhment of their end: it is but expedient, That they who are deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter the Liſts with them, ſhould have skill at the ſame weapon. This was perceived by <hi>Julian</hi> an irreconcileable enemy to the Faith of Chriſt, who commanded That the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be deprived of all Books of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: to compenſate which damage, <hi>Apollina</hi> the Elder turned the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> into He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Verſe: the Younger, the Goſpel into Dialogues, after the method of <hi>Plato.</hi> Of this skill which a Miniſter ought to be endued with, every Chriſtian is not a competent Judge. Not only the Law but the Goſpel, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it reaſonable, That every man ſhould be tried by his Peers. The judgment, which they give, muſt not be concealed, but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Church for her direction, That She may know whom to refuſe, and whom to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49823:83"/>as Miniſters. And it cannot be better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared than by ſome important actions, as Prayer, which has a tendency to invite from Heaven a Benediction upon the Heads and Hearts of thoſe, who are found qualified; and Impoſition of Hands, which ſolemnly points out unto the People, whom they are to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as their Paſtours. Theſe actions being exerted by one who is inveſted with authority, change the ſtate of private Men, and tranſlate them out of a Civil into an Eccleſiaſtical capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. A Sence of the neceſſity of ſuch Perſons has been always ſo great, that there is no Age but will furniſh us with inſtances of them.</p>
               <p>Before the Flood we meet with Preachers, which were ſolemnly Commiſſioned to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence the mind of Heaven. <hi>Noah</hi> is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">

This Office doth not open to every one, who can perſwade himſelf that he is indued with abilities agreeable to the importance of it, but is peculiar only to thoſe who are ordained to it. <hi>Noah</hi> is ſtiled the Eighth Preacher. It is more congruous to refer <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, not the Eighth <hi>Noah,</hi> (there being none of the name before) but <hi>Noah</hi> the Eighth Preacher. This contributes evidence to the act of Divine Juſtice in drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, which, (altho' eight eminent
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49823:84"/>Preachers of Righteouſneſs had been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to the promoting a reformation) neglected them all, and entertained their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice with ſcorn and deriſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe Eight are <hi>Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, Mathuſala, Lamech, Noah.</hi>

So that we are not deſtitute of authority, if we thus read the Text, Then <hi>Enos</hi> began to Preach in the name of the Lord. Namely, concerning the deſolation, which the prophaneneſs of <hi>Cain</hi>'s poſterity would certainly draw upon the World, if not prevented by a ſincere and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repentance.</p>
               <p>The Second Preacher is <hi>Cainan.</hi> He was ſo eminent in this Sacred Function, that the <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> who were Scribes, and ſolemnly ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to expound the Divine Law, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.55. received their denomination from him <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Third <hi>Mahalaleel.</hi> The Character of his Office is legible in his name. He was ſet apart to Praiſe God and proclaim his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Will.</p>

He was devoted ſolemnly to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and thoſe words, <hi>He walked with God,</hi> argue that he exerciſed his Sacred Function. The <hi>Jeruſalem Targum</hi> expounds them, He laboured in Truth before God, even as the Elders are ſaid to labour in Word and Doctrin, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>The Sixth is <hi>Methuſala.</hi> He is the Son of a Prophet, and in his very Name did foretel the Flood. It is compounded of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to import that when he was dead, God would ſend a univerſal Deluge. He died ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this prediction in the beginning of the year in which the Flood was.</p>
               <p>The Seventh was <hi>Lamech.</hi> He gave an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted teſtimony of his being under the power of a Prophetick Spirit, by naming his Son <hi>Noah,</hi> and expounding the meaning of it in theſe words, <hi>The ſame ſhall comfort us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our work, and the toil of our hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ground which the Lord hath curſed, Gen.</hi> 5.29. They plainly preſage ſome ſignal conſolation which would accrue to mankind by him.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:49823:85"/>
               <p>After the Flood, until the time of the Law, we are not without inſtances of a like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>The Firſt-born in every Family did execute the Sacerdotal Function.</p>
               <p>We read of Prieſts, before the order of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was inſtituted, and young men ſent by <hi>Moſes</hi> to offer burnt offerings, which the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> Paraphraſe renders the firſt-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.22. This is the reaſon why the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the poſterity of <hi>Heber,</hi> in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this Inſtitution, ſaies, Ye are come to the Church of the firſt-born. <hi>Eſau</hi> is ſtiled profane, becauſe he ſlighted this ſacred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. The Poſterity of <hi>Levi,</hi> who miniſtred about holy things, are ſaid to be taken in the room of the firſt-born, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>If there be any ambiguity in theſe Texts, Univerſal Tradition gives us no ſmall degree of aſſurance, that we are not miſtaken in that ſence which we have choſen. It is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral belief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Chriſtian Church, That the firſt-born were inveſted with the power we have attributed to them. <hi>Omnes primogeniti ex ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe Noae,</hi>

               <p>It is ſaid, That the Young men, <hi>Exo.</hi> 24. were not Prieſts. They did not ſprinkle the Blood upon the Altar. <hi>Eſau</hi> is ſtiled prophane, for contemning his Primogeniture, becauſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49823:85"/>the primacy and a double portion were annex'd to it by a divine inſtitution. The <hi>Levites</hi> which were ſubſtituted in the room of the firſt-born, were not Prieſts. The Firſt-born were not conſecrated to God, till the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> upon the account of their being preſerved, when the firſt-born of the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were deſtroyed.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49823:86"/>Tho' the Young Men did not ſprinkle the Blood, yet there were other Sacerdotal acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they were ingaged in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of, as the Dedication of the Offering, and the Mactation and Oblation of it by Fire, which are ſufficient to demonſtrate that they were veſted in a Sacerdotal Power: <gap reason="foreign">

Tho' a Divine Precept did entitle him to the Primacy and a double portion, yet it is not ſo proper to ſay, They were Holy and he Prophane, for neglecting of them.

               <p>If <hi>Levites</hi> be taken only for all the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> except <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Family, yet we have enough for our purpoſe. They were devoted to attend upon the Prieſthood, and miniſter about Sacred Things, when the Prieſts were ſo few, That they could not ſlay all the burnt-offerings, they helped them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.34. When one is ſaid to be in the room of another, it doth not argue a ſimilitude in every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, but an agreement in the main.

               <p>From the giving of the Law to the times of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> we have likewiſe ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Eccleſiaſtical Perſons. It being the pleaſure of God to be Worſhipped in two places, the Temple and the Synagogue, there were perſons ſolemnly ſet apart for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the duties of Religion required in both.</p>
               <p>To the Temple-Service the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> were devoted. The Rites belonging to their Conſecration are perſpicuous in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Theſe were divided into Prieſts, and thoſe who were aſſiſtant to them. The Prieſts were of the houſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and their work to offer Sacrifice and to Bleſs in the name of the Lord. The <hi>Levites</hi> had their ſeveral offices allotted to them. After the Ark was fixed, and the work, which they were originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to, in part brought to a period, they were digeſted into ſeveral Claſſes. Some of them were employed to praiſe God upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments

               <p>After the Reſurrection, we read of Three Orders, Apoſtles, Presbyters, Deacons. The Apoſtles were primary, or ſecondary.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49823:90"/>None doubt of the ſucceſſion of Presbyters and Deacons: and if we conſult the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity, they will be found as clear for the ſucceſſion of Apoſtles; as is evident from the words of <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> It is aſſerted by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Rabanus Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> That thoſe who were ſtiled Biſhops in the ages in which they lived, were called Apoſtles in the firſt age. By reaſon of a diſparity in Gifts, the Biſhops thought it too much, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to aſſume the name, altho' they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed their power of Order and Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The thing remained, altho' the name had many variations in divers ages. When the Empire was digeſted into Dioceſes, As in Cities there were chief Governours, ſtiled <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſores,</hi> in the Metropoles <hi>Proconſuls,</hi> in the Head Cities of Dioceſes the <hi>Vicarii</hi> of the Four <hi>Praefecti Praetorio:</hi> So in every City there was a Governour in Eccleſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, ſtiled a Biſhop, in every Metropolis an Archbiſhop, in the chief City of the Dioceſs, a Primate, except four, <hi>Rome, Conſtantinople, Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> and there the Governour in Church-affairs was honoured with the name of Patriarch, in imitation of the four <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecti Praetorio,</hi> which did always attend the Emperour, and govern in the head Cities of the Dioceſes by their Deputies. This laſt Title is of no earlier a date than the Second General Council. <hi>Socrates</hi> aſſerts,<note place="margin">L. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> That thoſe of whom it conſiſted, did conſtitute Patriarchs. This name was borrowed from the <hi>Jews.</hi> In their diſperſion, in order to the preventing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49823:91"/>an utter diſſolution, they conſtituted Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the Eaſtern Cities, and dignified them with this name. Their Authority continued till the Fourth Century, and then being taken away, the name was tranſlated to Chriſtian Rulers in Eccleſiaſtical affairs. This is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point of honour that ever Biſhops did ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at. The Oecumenical Power is a perfect uſurpation, and hath been gainſayed in all ages, except by ſome few, which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did diſcipline, as <hi>Pſapho</hi> did his Birds, and then ſend them forth to teach the people the ſame leſſon. The Church did never attempt to imitate the Empire ſo far, as to ſet up one Supreme Biſhop, as there was one Emperour. If a conformity had been carried ſo high, it would have been repugnant to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt, who conſtituted all the Apoſtles in a parity of power. No intimations of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority were directed to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but ſuch as the reſt of the Apoſtles were equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in. When Chriſt ſays, <hi>I will give thee the Keys,</hi> he doth not ſpeak to him exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. The ſame thing is ſpoken to all the Apoſtles. When he commands him <hi>to feed his Sheep,</hi> the words cannot import any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over the Apoſtles, who were Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and devoted to the ſame Work. When it is ſaid, <hi>upon this rock will I build my Church,</hi> Here is nothing expreſſed peculiar to him. The Church is built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. The Wall of the Holy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> hath Twelve Foundations, and in them, the name of the Twelve Apoſtles
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49823:91"/>of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. The contention about ſuperiority argues, That the Apoſtles knew nothing of the interpretation, which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> now give. If the words relate to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> all that can be inſerred from them, is, That he would be an eminent perſon, like a rock, conſtant and firm to death in the Faith of Chriſt, as many of the other Apoſtles were.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Now I proceed to the Second particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the manner, <hi>How men are to Worſhip God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The modes and circumſtance of Divine Worſhip, we are not always obliged to juſtifie with an expreſs teſtimony out of the Sacred Oracles. It is ſufficient for their vindication, That they are conſentaneous to the general rules of the Bible, and bear no oppoſition to any particular injunction. In order to our direction in this concern, I will lay down the following Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God muſt be Worſhipped inwardly, with all our Soul, with all our Heart, with all our Might. Our intellectual faculty muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the performance. A material con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to a Command without the knowledge of it, is no worſhip at all. A blind man, who hits the mark by chance, may as well be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a skilful Archer; as ſuch a perſon a True Worſhiper of God. If the underſtanding be not concerned, it is not a humane, much leſs a divine act. If the Intellect and Will, this preſent moment, concur to that which is truly good, and the next, the Mind alters, and the Will continues its purſuit; that which is now good in the appetitive faculty, will preſently
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49823:92"/>become evil, becauſe it acts contrary to its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate rule. Tho' there may be policy, yet there is but little piety in the practice of thoſe, who perſwade their Proſelytes, That light puts out the fire of devotion, and an implicit belief is the perfection of Religion. The truth is, They are ſo conſcious of the infirmity of the foundation they build upon, that they uſe their beſt endeavours to deprive others of their ſight, that they may be in no capacity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</p>
               <p>As we muſt Worſhip with our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo likewiſe with our Will; that which is free, and of our own election, is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, That God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected <hi>Cain,</hi> becauſe he offered a Sacrifice which was extorted by force out of the earth; and accepted <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe his victim was free and natural. Tho' he miſſed of the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet he hit upon a great Truth, That a free and uncompelled obedience is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Divine Will. God being a Spirit, is concerned chiefly in the frame of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and diſvalues that Service which doth not proceed from them.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6.4.</note> The windows of the Temple which <hi>Solomon</hi> dedicated to him were broad within and narrow without: his eye looks more within upon the temper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of our hearts, than without upon our external performances.</p>
               <p>All the faculties of our Soul muſt be ſcrew'd up to the higheſt pitch. In the Intellect there muſt be a ſuperlative eſteem of the Divine Majeſty, in the Will the deepeſt devotion.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49823:92"/>Every ſacred performance challengeth the moſt reverential regards. Altho' there may be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable exceſſes in the imperate acts of the Body, yet there is no fear of them in the elicite operations of the Soul. It is impoſſible to value love, and obey God too much. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good requires the utmoſt vigour of a finite Spirit, when it is converſant about it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God muſt be worſhipped outwardly with the Body. It is to be preſented as a living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</note> holy and acceptable to him. We muſt not imitate them, who uſe to take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all the fleſh of their victims, and offer up nothing but the Blood and Soul to their Deities. Our Bodies being the Lords as well as our Spirits, and very proper inſtruments to commend the practice of Religion to others, they are not to be exempted from this Service. Outward profeſſion, which cannot be without the acts of the body, is a duty as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion. <hi>Adam</hi> did wear the skins of the beaſts, which he ſacrificed to God. The Scripture never cenſures bodily Service, but the want of the heart, and a right direction of the intentions in the performance of it. He who Worſhips God with his Body, and ſuffers his Soul at the ſame time to be under irrela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive motions, is like a Souldier, who imploys his Scabbard in the ſervice of his Commander, and his Sword to ſome other purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All the modes of the Body muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, orderly, and tending to Edification. It is the pleaſure of him, who is the Supreme Head of the Church, to give this general
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49823:93"/>rule, and to furniſh ſubordinate Governours with ſuch diſcretion, as will enable them to make convenient deductions from it, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes. Upon this account the Apoſtle appeals to Nature, that is, natural reaſon, when he treats about matters of order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and aſſerts, That diſorder will adminiſter occaſion to unbelievers, to charge the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation with madneſs, that is, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment contrary to the rule of common reaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Different deductions from this general rule, is no juſt ground for diſtinct Churches to commence a conteſt one againſt another, and by this means, violate the Unity of the Univerſal. Decency is not confined to a point, but has a certain latitude: Under a Genus there are more Species than one. The <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Army at <hi>Cannae,</hi> were not drawn up in the ſame form; and yet in both there was a mode agreeable to the rules of Military Order. Upon this account, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church has no quarrel with the antient, altho' ſhe differs from her in matters of this nature. Formerly it was thought to be very decent to ſtand at Prayer, on the Lord's day, in token of the Reſurrection: To plunge three times, thoſe who were to be Baptiſed, in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Trinity; to cloath them, when they came out of the water, with a white garment. Altho' theſe cuſtoms are now laid aſide: yet we are ſo far from reproaching thoſe who did uſe them, that we highly value their authority in the important concerns of Religion.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49823:93"/>The ſeveral parts of the ancient Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they differed in things of this Nature: yet they had communion together.<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Victor,</hi> ſays, That ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that they were to faſt but one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Paſſover, ſome Two, ſome Forty, nevertheleſs they had Peace. Thoſe Churches which diſſented in ſuch matters,<note place="margin">Sozom.</note> uſe to ſend the Sacrament one to another, as a token of their agreement in the Faith. They thought it a vain thing to be divorced, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome different cuſtomes, when there was a harmony betwixt them in the great concerns of Religion. <hi>Firmilianus</hi> aſſerts,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Cypr.</note> That the ſame Rites were not at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and the like differences were in other places: yet the Unity and Peace of the Catholick Church was not broken. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> takes notice,<note place="margin">Ep. ad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulan, <hi>86.</hi>
                  </note> That in the garment of the King's Daughter, there is variety of work, to import, that there may be diverſe Rites in the Church, and yet all reconcileable with the Unity of the Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Tho' this variety is very excuſable in different Churches, yet it is highly expedient and deſirable, that in the ſame Church there ſhould be the ſame external mode of Religion, Edification is the great deſign which ought to be aimed at in an Eccleſiaſtical Community. There is nothing which is more oppoſite to this end, than diſcord and contention; and nothing will ſooner kindle and blow up the fire of contention, than differences of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Tho' Men at diſtance do bear one with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49823:94"/>another in ſuch variations, yet when they are near, and in frequent Communion, under the ſame conſtitution, they are apt to take great diſtaſte. We like well the different faſhions of another Country, and treat Strangers which are in them with ſignifications of a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: yet if any of our own Community af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſuch an exotick Garb, they are uſually the object of vulgar ſcorn and deriſion. The different dreſs of one, is a reproach to another, and charges him with folly and weakneſs, as tho' he was not able to diſcern what is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; and under ſuch an imputation Men are commonly very uneaſie, and break out into an exchange of the greateſt unkindneſs. The animoſity occaſioned by a variation in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rites, is uſually more violent than that which ariſeth from a diverſity in Civil. The pretence of a Sacred Inſtitution communicates an edge to the Spirits of thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for them. They are eaſily induced to believe, That they are engaged in the quarrel of the Deity, and that their zeal for them will render the Divine Power propitious to them. This conſideration puſhes them forward, and makes them as fierce as the Poet repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the <hi>Combites</hi> to be againſt the <hi>Tentyrites.</hi>
               </p>

                  <l>Held to be Gods, than they themſelves adore.</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:49823:94"/>
               <p>Such heats are frequently attended with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry direful conſequences.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.5.</note> They produce ſtrong Convulſion-fits in the Community. Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, Lightnings, and an Earthquake are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as proceeding from the Fire of the Altar. The Fire which conſumed the Senate-Houſe in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> began in the Church.<note place="margin">Socr. p. <hi>727.</hi>
                  </note> Nothing can be ſafe, when Men are inflamed with a zeal for their own private Sentiments. They think every one is under an obligation to ſubmit to them. The want of power is the only thing which gives a temper to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment. So ſoon as they are numerous and prevalent enough, nothing will ſatisfie but a complete Conqueſt, all muſt ſtoop to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions. They account it an evidence of weakneſs, if they cannot; and of irreligion, if they will not ſettle that which they conceive to be beſt. And they believe they are not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the enjoyment of their power, except they ſuppreſs others, and bend them into a compliance with them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If Conteſts ariſe in the ſame Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout external modes, a ready way to compoſe them, is to appeal to Primitive Order, and give the preference to thoſe who come neareſt to it. If we view it as it lies in the Holy Scriptures, and thoſe undoubted Records which are next in Antiquity, we ſhall find it to be, not pompous and theatrical, but grave and comely; not calculated for the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Senſitive but Intellectual part, not apt to divert the Intention from the import of Worſhip: and yet ſufficient to ſecure it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49823:95"/>againſt the aſſaults of Rudeneſs and Contempt. The Miniſterial part was appropriated to Three Orders of Men, Apoſtles, Elders and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, perſons ſound in Doctrin, Sober and unſpotted in their Converſation. Presbyters were ordained in every Church and City. The ſolemn time for Sacred Conventions was the firſt of the week.</p>
               <p>In the Aſſemblies, The Men were uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Women veiled. The Miniſter began with Prayer. This he directed to God with the moſt important expreſſions of Devotion, without the help of ſuch a Prompter as the Ethnick Prieſts uſe to have, leſt they might forget the names of any of their Gods which were very numerous. After this, were read the Writings of the Apoſtles and Prophets. And becauſe ſome things are hard to be underſtood, and thoſe which are eaſie, ought not only to be entertained in the Head, but the Heart: in the next place followed Preaching, with the moſt pathetical Exhortations to Practice. When the Sermon was finiſhed, all did riſe from their ſeat, and joyn in Prayer. After this, ſucceeded the celebration of the Holy Communion, in which the Preſident poured forth Thankſgiving and Supplication with all his might, the People expreſſing their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, by ſaying, <hi>Amen.</hi> All was concluded with a contribution for the relief of the Poor.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe circumſtances, There were ſome Symbolical Rites in uſe, namely, The Love-Feaſts, the Holy Kiſs. As the laying of theſe aſide in ſome time, doth plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49823:95"/>That the Church did not believe, they were grounded upon a perpetual inſtitution, but taken up upon Prudential Conſiderations, in a Conformity to the general rules of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: So the Practice of them in the pureſt Age, when Chriſtian Simplicity was in its greateſt vigour, doth manifeſtly teach us, That we have no juſt grounds to condemn our own Church, becauſe ſhe retains ſome Rites, not burdenſome in their number, and as innocent in their meaning as They were.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If by reaſon of paucity of records, or any obſcurity in thoſe which are extant, it cannot be agreed what was the Primitive Order: The ready way to Peace, before Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority has made any determination, is, for the ſeveral Members of the Church to make prudent Condeſcenſions one to another, ſo as none may be nouriſhed in their errour, nor any have any juſt reaſon of offence adminiſtred to them. This was the condition of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> when S. <hi>Paul</hi> did addreſs his Epiſtle to them. Their conteſts were violent, Authority had not yet interpoſed. The Counſel of the Apoſtle has an entire aſpect upon this purpoſe. <hi>Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not; and let not him who eateth not, judge him who eateth. One man eſteemeth one day above another, another man eſteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</hi> Matters were not then ripe enough in that Church for a deciſion. The converted <hi>Jews</hi> had not a full inſight into the liberty which Chriſt purchaſed for them. Therefore
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49823:96"/>S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not determine the caſe on either ſide, but adviſeth every member to a prudent demeanour, and <hi>To follow the things which make for peace, and things with which one may ediſie another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſuſpending the exerciſe of his authority in theſe circumſtances, cannot be brought into an argument againſt all determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations about things which are adiaphorous, for he in other Churches did decide this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as appears by his Epiſtles to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians. How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye deſire again to be in bondage, ye obſerve days, months, times and years,</hi> Gal. 4.9, 10. <hi>Let no man therefore judge ye in meat or in drink, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the New Moon, or Sabbath days, which are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body is of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. Certainly, if the Apoſtle had believed, That all Churches are to enjoy a freedom, equal to that in which he left the <hi>Romans,</hi> he would not have been ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive as he is with theſe eminent Churches.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If Condeſcenſions cannot be procured, and circumſtances become ſuch, That Rulers believe it prudential to make a determination, both weak and ſtrong, are bound to acquieſce in the deciſion. Such a determination is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sphere of humane authority. God has commanded all that is Good, and interdicted all Evil. The only things which are left to be the immediate object of Sublunary Power, are thoſe which are neither. They may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeful or not uſeful, as circumſtances
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49823:96"/>happen, but in their own nature they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or evil. If any apply themſelves to the doing of them, for the ſake of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick bonity, which they fanſie to be in them, and others ſtand at a diſtance from them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of ſome imaginary obliquity, and by this means the Tranquillity of the Community is endangered, Rulers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly concerned to keep the Peace, and prevent thoſe miſchiefs, which they cannot but have a proſpect of, if ſuch different pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices continue. And this they cannot do without making a determination. If things be let alone, and every one enjoys a freedom to do that which ſeems beſt to him, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party will at laſt carry all, and force others to be vaſſals to their pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Certainly, If God has inveſted Governours with a right to preſerve the Peace of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, he does by the ſame grant, entitle them to the uſe of ſuch means as have the moſt direct aſpect upon this purpoſe; and nothing looks fuller this way, than a prudent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. What can be more expedient to prevent the ſpreading of Fire, than to remove the fuel which foments it. And if thoſe who are over us, have a power to make a deciſion, it muſt neceſſarily be a duty in us to ſubmit to it. Otherwiſe their Authority will be in vain, and of no ſignification.</p>
               <p>What is objected againſt the Legality of ſuch a determination, (That it accuſeth the Scripture of imperfection, takes away our Chriſtian Liberty, neceſſitates us to violate
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49823:97"/>the Law concerning ſcandal) will be found to be of no moment, if duly conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The perfection of the Written Word, is to be eſtimated by its ſufficiency to accompliſh thoſe ends for which it was given. The end of the Penning of it, is to acquaint us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rules, with all the eſſential parts of Worſhip, and whatſoever is of peremptory neceſſity, in relation to our Eternal Beatitude in a Future State. As for the modes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Veneration nothing more is intended for our direction than General Precepts, from which we may, by the aid of that Reaſon, with which God has endued us, collect what is expedient in particular caſes. And when that Wiſdom which preſides over the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, makes an inference from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule, and tenders it to our obſervation, the diſhonour of imperfection is not reflected upon the Bible; becauſe nothing is done, but that which is agreeable to its intention. Of this, We have a manifeſt demonſtration in the Old Teſtament. When the Law was ſo punctual as to name the very Pins belonging to the Tabernacle, the Liberty which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for was allowed. There were many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions in the Synagogues, which had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to countenance them from the Scripture, but General Commands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The determination of Authority is no prejudice to Chriſtian Liberty.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.14, 16.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth adviſe us to a ſubmiſſion to Governours, as free, which aſſures us, That freedom is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a ſubjection to their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49823:97"/>Chriſtian Liberty conſiſts in a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from that which our bleſſed Lord has aboliſhed. That which he did annul was the Typical Law. It being deſigned, as a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, That He was to come into the World, and tranſact the deſired Work of Atonement and Reconciliation, when this great affair was accompliſhed, the ſhadows became uſeleſs, and none were obliged to believe that they were tied up unto them any longer, by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appointment. This is that which the Apoſtle has his eye upon, when he exhorts the <hi>Galatians, To ſtand faſt in the liberty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>with which Jeſus Chriſt had made them free.</hi> There were ſome amongſt them, which did attempt to influence them, with this perſwaſion, That the Typical Precepts were ſtill in force, and none could be juſtified without a compliance with them. Governours now may determine ſome particular modes relating to Divine Worſhip, and yet deprive us of none of this Liberty, provided that they impreſs no ſuch ſignification upon them, That the Meſſias is yet to come; and that they impoſe them, without any neceſſity of believing, That they are of Divine Inſtitution. And that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them be ſo ſmall, as not to make them burthenſome to us, and prejudicial to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. External Rites may be ſo multiplied, that altho' ſingly conſidered, They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocuous, yet conjunctively, They may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in darkning the ſpirituality of Divine Worſhip, and diverting the mind from the true import of it. A multitude of leaves is a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49823:98"/>frequent impediment to the maturation of fruits.</p>
               <p>Chriſt did put a period not only to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, but the Judicial Law; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, our freedom from the obligation of it, is a branch of Chriſtian Liberty: and yet none will preſume to aſſert, That this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is loſt, when Chriſtians in every Countrey where they inhabit, ſubmit to the judicial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of their Lawful Prince.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The determination we ſpeak of, puts no neceſſity upon us to violate the Law concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcandal. The true meaning of that Law is, That we muſt comply with the infirmity of our weak Brother in adiaphorous matters, ſo long as we are left to our own freedom. But in caſe we come to be limited in the exerciſe of our freedom by the Authority which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides over us, That obligation in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances is ſuperſeded. It is a greater duty to conform to Authority in lawful Things, than to comport with the weakneſs of theſe who are in a private capacity; and when two obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations meet, and both cannot be ſatisfied, the leſſer always gives place and yields to the greater.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now I proceed to the Third Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>The End we are to propoſe to our ſelves in the acts of Religious Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To render our performances acceptable, Two Things are of peremptory neceſſity. The Act muſt be good, which we are ingaged in: and our Intentions right in the doing of it. As to the preſent caſe, namely, The Worſhip
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49823:98"/>of God, none doubt of the goodneſs of the Act. The moſt compendious way to diſcover how we are to direct our Intention in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, is to conſider, what it has a a tendency to. The <hi>finis operis</hi> will lead us to the <hi>finis operantis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He who duely ponders the nature of it, will diſcover that it has a tendency to theſe Three Things: <hi>The Glory of God, The Salvation of the Soul, The Preſervation of the Community.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Glory of God.</hi> This is Twofold, either Internal or External. Internal conſiſts in the reſplendent and peerleſs perfection of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this can admit of no increaſe. It is boundleſs and infinite already.</p>
               <p>External imports a ſimilitude to, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of this intrinſick excellency: and to this an addition may be made ſeveral ways, as in our Thoughts, Words, and Works.</p>
               <p>We do this in our Thoughts, When we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain honourable apprehenſions of the Divine Majeſty, and form Ideas agreeable to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes he is inveſted with.</p>
               <p>In our Words, When we make ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate ſounds, as are appropriated to the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of a ſincere Confeſſion and humble acknowledgment of his Superlative Perfection. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls the Tongue his Glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an Inſtrument adapted to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 148.13.</note> and the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Works whereby he is glorified, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his own or ours. The Heavens declare
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49823:99"/>his Glory. All the productions of his hands, ſet forth his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs. The Ark, with a Propitiatory, a lively Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of reconciling Mercy, is ſtiled the Glory. His bleſſed Son, in whom ſhines forth the whole conſtellation of divine perfections, The Brightneſs of his Glory.</p>
               <p>We glorifie him in our Works, When we are ingaged in ſuch as are Holy and Good. Their ſimilitude to the Divine Will and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may without any incongruity be called External Glory. They ſet forth what he is, and what he is moſt pleaſed and delighted with. In the number of ſuch actions we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a place to Religious Worſhip, it being an humble acknowledgment of thoſe boundleſs perfections which reſide in him. Praiſe is an ingredient diffuſed thro' all the parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. In Prayer, Receiving the Sacraments; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Hearing his Holy Word, we ſet forth his moſt worthy Praiſe: and <hi>Whoſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth God, Pſ.</hi> 50.23.</p>
               <p>It likewiſe has a propitious aſpect upon <hi>The eternal Salvation of the Soul.</hi> The enjoyment of this felicity is to be expected only in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and God has appointed, That none ſhall enter into that bleſſed place, but thoſe who Worſhip him in this preſent ſtate. The way into the Holy of Holieſt, by his unchangeable appointment lies thro' the Temple, where all the parts of Religious Worſhip are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The gate which opens into the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Manſions, is not only ſtrait, but ſo low that none can enter into it, but thoſe who
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49823:99"/>ſtoop, and are ingaged here in humble and ſubmiſſive agnitions of the Divine Excellency. The grand work in Heaven being to perform the moſt ſignal acts of Adoration. He that is not in ſome meaſure inur'd to them in this World, is deſtitute of an aptitude and fitneſs for that bleſſed imployment. It would be as great a ſurpriſal to any who are totally ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers here to the Hallelujahs and Praiſes, which are due to the moſt high God, to be placed in a moment in the midſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Quire, as it was to the <hi>Syrian</hi> hoſt to be unawares in the midſt of <hi>Samaria.</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven inſtead of being a place of reſt, would be a real diſquiet to ſuch unqualified perſons.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Divine Worſhip has a tendency to promote <hi>The Preſervation of the Community.</hi> It excellently diſpoſeth Princes to govern. Their honorary addreſſes to him, who is higher than the higheſt, influence them with a due tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind towards their Subjects. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire to comport with the pleaſure of him, whom they in ſincerity adore, and they muſt neceſſarily know, That it is his pleaſure that they ſhould imitate him, in the acts of his Clemency and Goodneſs. And ſuch acts are the Cement, which unites the Hearts of the Prince and People together, and ſecures the moſt laſting conjunction to all the parts of the Community.</p>
               <p>It likewiſe diſpoſeth Subjects to obey. They who in the integrity of their hearts, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Supreme Being, can do no leſs than pay their acknowledgments to his Vice-gerent.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49823:100"/>Infinite Sovereignty being the object of their Veneration; whereſoever they meet with the Type and reſemblance of it, they cannot paſs by it without an expreſſion of their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards for the proto-types ſake.</p>
               <p>We may add to all this, That Worſhip rightly performed, draws a perpetuating bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the Community. Such Princes as have been moſt careful to advance the due cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of it, have been attended in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with ſignal Felicities. <hi>David</hi> who made it his firſt and laſt work to ſettle Religion, did thereby ſettle his Kingdom. His Subjects were united, his enemies diſſipated, his friends increaſed. But <hi>Solomon</hi> who divided Divine Worſhip betwixt <hi>Jehova</hi> and other Gods, had his Kingdom divided: Then parts were given to his Servant, and but Two to his Son.</p>
               <p>Theſe three particulars, <hi>The Glory of God, The Salvation of the Soul, The Preſervation of the Community,</hi> Religious Worſhip having a tendency to promote, it muſt be our duty, when we are ingaged in it, ſo to direct our intentions, as to caſt our eye upon them. But that which challengeth the firſt place in our thoughts, is, <hi>The Glory of God.</hi> The reaſon of this order will be very conſpicuous, if we conſider, 1. The Obligations which we lie under to the Supreme Being. His favours are ſo conſtant and ſuperlative, that they admit of no delay, but require in the firſt place, in every addreſs to him, ſomething to be returned in point of gratitude. It is an undervaluing of the kindneſs we every moment receive to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49823:100"/>any other duty before it. Now by reaſon God is infinite in Perfection, and by conſequence uncapable of receiving any thing from us, but a decent and becoming acknowledgment, and ſetting forth of his intrinſick Glory; this muſt neceſſarily take the upper hand of all other ends in our Intentions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The glorifying God is the firſt of thoſe duties which are morally Good. It is the Form which conſtitutes and makes them to be what they are. All Good whatſoever, is either ſuch, as God Wills, becauſe it is ſo: or elſe ſo, becauſe God Wills it. The Eſſence of the firſt lies in a ſimilitude to the immutable perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine Nature: of the Second, to the ſacred determinations of his Bleſſed Will. This ſimilitude in the Creature to God, is that which we mean by his External Glory. The whole Creation contributes to this purpoſe, ſo long as it retains ſuch a compoſure, as live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſents his Goodneſs, Wiſdom and Power. When any part degenerates into a frame, diſlike to the Idea in the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to which it was made, then his Glory is eclipſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The glorifying God, is the primary duty which Chriſtian Religion devolves upon us. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Chriſt the Inſtitutor of our holy Profeſſion, was uſhered into the World by the Heavenly Hoſt with this Hymn, <hi>Glory be to God in the higheſt:</hi> when he was about to leave it, He prayed in theſe words, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Name.</hi> The deſign of his whole
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49823:101"/>Life was to annihilate all theſe imaginary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, which impede the ſhining of the Divine Glory. The People which he has redeemed,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</note> are ſaid to be <hi>A choſen generation; That they may ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> His Church is repreſented with the Moon under her feet, to ſignifie her diſguſt of all ſelfiſh interpoſals which eclipſe the Glory of the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>He hath made all things for himſelf,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4.</note> that is, with a purpoſe and deſign to ſet forth his intrinſick Glory. His Glory primarily conſiſts in his peerleſs and tranſcendent Goodneſs. He has made his Creatures, as ſo many veſſels to entertain the overflowings of it. <hi>The earth is full of the goodneſs of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.5.</note> The bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſplendour of it is viſible in all the productions of his hand. Tho' the Glory of his Wiſdom, Power and Juſtice is likewiſe conſpicuous; yet becauſe his Goodneſs is the leading Attribute, and ſets all theſe a-work, his Wiſdom to contrive the diverſity of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, his Power to fetch them out of the Abyſs of nothing, his Juſtice to correct irregularities and preſerve a due temper in the Univerſe; the Glory of all theſe in effect is nothing but the Glory of his Goodneſs. Indeed in Men it is eſteemed a character of Vanity to mind their own glory, it having no real foundation to ſupport it: if the Supreme Being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf, all ſublunary excellency is in a dependence, and obnoxious to diſappointment. But in God it is otherwiſe. His Goodneſs
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49823:101"/>being boundleſs, and his excellency unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he cannot but take an infinite delight in it. And if it be no blemiſh to delight in the Original, it can be none to be pleaſed with the Copy, and to require it as a duty from us, to ſet forth his Glory in our Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; eſpecially conſidering there is nothing more agreeable to the end of our Creation, and perfective of Intellectual Nature, than to be thus imployed.<note place="margin">Hieroc. p. <hi>25</hi>
                  </note> When he commands this from us, he enjoyns us to be like unto himſelf, to imitate his Goodneſs, to lead a virtuous life, to abſtain from all things which bear an oppoſition to his Nature and Will. And What can be more beneficial? This lays a ſure foundation for our inward Peace, it derives upon us many external Benedictions, there is nothing more honourable than to be like unto God, and ingaged in a Converſation, in which the reſemblance of his Holineſs is viſible.</p>
               <p>If the Glory of God has all theſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to commend it, we have enough to juſtifie the order of our Thoughts, and induce us to believe, That it ought to have the chief room in them, in all our addreſſes to Heaven. When This has taken its place according to the dignity of its Nature, it is no infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any precept, to have an eye upon the other ſubordinate ends, in particular, upon eternal life. God has for this purpoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to publick view. He has brought Immortality to Light by the Goſpel, and ſtiled it, <hi>The prize of the high calling,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49823:102"/>to a cuſtom at the Olympick Games, where the Prize was hung over the Goal, as an invitation to the Racers, to exert the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their vigour. It can be no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in us to have an eye upon that, which God has ſet forth, that it may be looked upon. This practice is no prejudice to his Glory, which is ſo blended with our eternal intereſt, That he who aims at the one, muſt neceſſarily hit the other. If we may eat and drink with a deſign to preſerve our Temporal Life, and yet not violate that injunction, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, do all to the Glory of God;</hi> without controverſie we may Worſhip with a purpoſe to gain Eternal Life, without contracting the guilt of an infringement. There is no fear of falling under the imputation of a mercenary Spirit, ſo long as we eye Salvation as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect not of humane Merit, but divine Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: not as the Sovereign End, but that which doth miniſter and is ſubſervient to <hi>The Glory of God.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Concerning Aſſiſtance relating to Worſhip.</head>
               <p>OUR Firſt Parent, by his fall from the Tree of Knowledge, did not only hurt himſelf, but his poſterity. All, deſcended from him, are under an Hereditary diſtemper. How frequent is it for children to expreſs an inclination to thoſe impieties, which they never ſaw acted? If they were not under ſome ſinful prepoſſeſſions, no reaſonable account can be given, why a few bad Examples ſhould be more efficacious in the impreſſing of Vice upon them, than the moſt Religious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Virtue. If we look into the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who are come to a mature Age, we ſhall find them, generally, violating the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Order of the Divine Will, in giving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency to the leſſer Good, and degrading that which of right doth challenge the Priority. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more manifeſt, than an univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion to ſuch objects as are incongruous to intellectual Nature, and far below the dignity of an Immortal Spirit. This diſtemper is ſo manifeſt, that all ſorts of men have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it. The Sacred Writers have ſet it forth in a very clear light. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the old Serpent did infuſe poiſon
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49823:103"/>into <hi>Eve,</hi> whereby the nature of her off-ſpring is vitiated: and That Circumciſion was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted as an Antidote. Therefore when a Child is Circumciſed, it is the cuſtome, to have one ſtand ready with a veſſel filled with duſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>praeputium.</hi> This figure of Original corruption they mingle with the food of the Serpent, to ſignifie, That thro' his contrivance, it was brought into the World. This they account not only a diſeaſe but a ſin, which makes them obnoxious to Hell: and therefore in the form uſed at Circumciſion, it is expreſſed, That that Sacrament delivers them, <hi>ab inferis;</hi> which cannot be, when they are but eight days old, in caſe they are not from their birth prepoſſeſſed with ſomething, which makes them liable to that condemnation.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s verſes, This hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in <hi>Hierocles</hi>'s Comment upon them <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>By it we are deprived of an ability to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſerve God in an acceptable manner, and come to labour under ſeveral defects. We want light to direct us how to Worſhip him. Strength to perform, what we are directed to. Merit to procure acceptance of what we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Help is provided for us under all theſe neceſſities. We have the holy Scripture to give us light. The Holy Spirit to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſtrength. The bleſſed Merits of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to procure acceptance. I will treat of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p n="1">I. We have the Holy Scripture to direct us. This is a perfect Digeſt of the mind of Heaven
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49823:103"/>concerning all things neceſſary to Salvation. We have in it not only the true meaſures of Faith, <hi>without which none can pleaſe God;</hi> but the exact rules of Holineſs, <hi>without which none can ſee him.</hi> In order to the underſtanding the ground of our dependence upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Directory, the following Propoſitions are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Worſhipping of God is of perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory neceſſity in order to Salvation. None can be admitted to a fruition of the beatifical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but thoſe, who have paid their due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to him in this life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, our bleſſed Lord and his Apoſtles did by Oral Tradition reveal all things neceſſary to Salvation. The deſign of their Sermons was nothing but a diſcloſure of the whole Counſel of God about this grand concernment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What they ſpoke, was evidenced to be the real mind of God, by inward characters of Divinity, and external miraculous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As the Supreme Being has ſet his Arms upon his Works, whereby it may be known, who is the Maker of them: So he has impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Signatures upon his Word. There are ſome particulars in it, which are evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, That a Divine Hand is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the compoſure of it.</p>
               <p>In the Prophetical part we have manifeſt indications of Divinity. It is peculiar to God, to foretel things to come. This in the moſt exact manner is frequently done. <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> are by name expreſſed many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49823:104"/>they appeared in the World. <hi>Alexander</hi>'s conqueſt, with his miraculous expedition is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Daniel</hi> with as much clearneſs, as if he had been a Spectator of his Military At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements. The time, place, and manner of the Birth of our bleſſed Lord is expreſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told many Centuries, before it came to paſs.</p>
               <p>In the Preceptive part, Laws occur concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inward motions of the Soul, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties to be inflicted upon tranſgreſſors, which can be framed by none but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If by Men, they muſt either be Wiſe and Good, or Fooliſh and Bad. Not the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not conſiſtent with the methods of a Wiſe Legiſlator to make a Law, and fortifie it with a minatory Sanction about things, of which he is no competent Judge: Nor of a good Man, to aſcribe a Divine Original to that, which, he knows, has no other beginning, than what it received from his own invention. Not the ſecond, Becauſe there is ſo much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Wiſdom and Goodneſs reſplendent in them, as will not ſuffer us to ſuſpect, That they were the contrivance of ill Men, or ſuch as were defective in point of Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>In the Dogmatical part, The deſire of all Nations, together with the redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by him, from that burden, under which the whole Creation groaned, is fully diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tho' the greateſt Wits ſpent themſelves in their inquiries about it; yet they were as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the true Fountain of this Bleſſing, as of the Head of <hi>Nilus.</hi> They ſpeak indeed, (in order to the atoning of the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49823:104"/>of the Sacrifices of Plants, Beaſts and Men: but the Sacrifice of him, who is both God and Man, never entred into their thoughts. After their beſt endeavours, without that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which they hoped for, a diſcovery was made by the Prophets and Apoſtles. The wiſeſt of Men did embrace it, and made it their choice rather to loſe their lives, than to renounce the belief of it. It is natural for us to conceive That to be True, which ſuch perſons entertain with ſo reſolved an aſſent: and that Truth to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed by Divine Wiſdom, which all humane Wiſdom (tho' engaged in a diligent inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after it) could make no diſcovery of. This great Bleſſing, which God had prepared for them which love him, <hi>no eye had ſeen, nor ear heard, neither had it entred into the heart of any man to conceive,</hi> till a Revelation from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was vouchſafed.</p>
               <p>In the Promiſſory part, We have a clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Future State of Men. All the Heathens were very inquiſitive about it. Every one of them deſired life, and that their life might be happy, and this happy life Eternal. This put an edge upon them in their ſearch: and yet they did not arrive at any true ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was not inferiour in Wiſdom to the beſt of them, was very dark in his apprehenſions, as appears by his dying words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Juſt. Mar. Or. Coh. ad Graecos. p. <hi>33.</hi>
                  </note> &amp;c. But now is the hour of going away, mine to dy, yours to live; which of us ſhall be moſt happy, is unknown to all except God himſelf. This, which natural reaſon is ſo much puzzled about,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49823:105"/>The Doctrin of Chriſt has made a full diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of. Life and Immortality are brought to light by the Goſpel, and repreſented in ſuch clear colours, that many upon the diſcovery became impatient of a confinement in this ſublunary State, and earneſtly covet their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, that they might be tranſlated into an enjoyment of it. It is very agreeable to us to conceive, That where Reaſon did end in its inquiries about this matter, Revelation began: and that the Wiſdom of Heaven is concerned in this acceptable diſcloſure. The lineaments of it, are as conſpicuous in it, as the cotrivance of <hi>Joab</hi> in the ſpeech of the Woman of <hi>Tekoa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As innate characters, ſo external miraculous operations evidence the reality of the Word of God. By reaſon of the ſlowneſs of Men to entertain it, it was the Divine Pleaſure to quicken their belief by Miracles.</p>
               <p>Under the Old Teſtament, ſupernatural works were done by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: Under the New, by Chriſt and the Apoſtles. After their Preaching (in order to the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it) They did ſuch things, as exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the productions of Nature. There was no colluſion in them. They did not vaniſh, ſo ſoon as they were done: but by their perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence did demonſtrate their reality. They were not done in corners but openly, in the preſence of the moſt critical Spectators. They were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in an inſtant, at the ſpeaking of a word. They were ſo evidently great, That ſublimated malice had not confidence to attribute them to any thing leſs, than to him who has the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49823:105"/>in the Infernal Kingdom: Which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny was ſufficiently refuted by the reply of our Saviour; That no Man can with reaſon apprehend, that the Prince of Darkneſs would be acceſſary to the production of ſuch works, as tend to the confirmation of a Doctrin cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the ruine of his Kingdom. Theſe Miracles were the Credential Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our bleſſed Lord did evidence, that both He and his Doctrin came from God. No Man can produce them without the influence of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power: and it is not congruous to the Veracity and Goodneſs of the Supreme Being, to lend ſuch a power to any perſon in order to the ratification of an errour.</p>
               <p>It is vain to pretend, That Miracles can be of no uſe in the preſent caſe, becauſe of the difficulty in diſcerning which are True, and which are Falſe. It may be as well ſaid, That the Broad Seal is no certain evidence of the Royal Authority, becauſe there is a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may be counterfeited. A due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all circumſtances will quickly deliver us from the fear of being impoſed upon. A diligent circumſpection doth often diſcover that to be Braſs, which is commonly received for current Coin. If Miracles were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable from lying Wonders, our Saviour would not ſo familiarly appeal unto them, as he doth, for the juſtification of his Doctrin. Tho' there may be ſome difficulty, yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways: a Miracle is a work that exceeds the bounds of Nature. Theſe bounds in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not concealed, but obvious to every
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49823:106"/>capacity. It is clear, That a finite Being is ſo limited, as not to be able by its own power to raiſe to life, one that has been four days dead, to give ſight to one who is born blind, to cure Chronical diſeaſes in a moment, at the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a word. Where the bounds of Nature are clear, as they are in theſe inſtances, there can be no difficulty in diſcerning, when they are exceeded, and by conſequence, when a true Miracle is produced.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Word of God with its Internal Characters, together with a perfect relation of the miraculous External effects whereby it was evidenced, are faithfully committed to Writing. Supernal direction was given not only about the matter, but the manner. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles the letters <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſaies that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is of Divine Inſpiration. The Men, imployed about this Work, were perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all circumſtances. Their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was ſo exact, That had they been leſt to the conduct of their own private Spirits, they could not have been miſtaken thro' igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſetting down matters of fact. Neither have they made any miſrepreſentation out of deſign. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had been inſtigated by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate regards to compoſe the Pentateuch, he would not have recorded the infamy of his own family. If any fraud had been uſed in the Penning the New Teſtament, no doubt many enemies as well as friends, who were Spectators of the Miracles, and Auditors of the Doctrin, living to ſee the relation in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; would have diſcovered it. Yet we never
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49823:106"/>read of any attempt of this nature: but on the contrary, <hi>Porphyry, Celſus</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> in their cavils againſt Chriſtian Religion, ſuppoſe the matter of fact, That ſuch Doctrin was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch Miracles done.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Writing in the Old Teſtament is digeſted into four and twenty Books: In the New into twenty ſeven, five Hiſtorical, one and twenty Epiſtolical, one Prophetical. For this number we have the moſt clear Tradition. <hi>Ezra</hi> having conſigned the Canon of the Old Teſtament, S. <hi>John</hi> of the New, both of them perſons inſpired by the Spirit of God, and of great Authority amongſt Men; The Tradition came in ſo full a ſtream from their hands, that in every age it has born down all the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which has been made againſt it. This Tradition we have juſt reaſon to embrace, altho' we reject others: becauſe it adds nothing to the doctrin of the Bible, as the Pipe adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Water, which is conveyed by it. It is virtually contained in the Scripture. It owes much of its univerſality to the intrinſick excellency of the Sacred Oracles, which upon the firſt conſulting, commend themſelves to the good opinion of every intelligent Reader. It is of greater latitude, than any other Tradition, which is not formally contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. As for others, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are able to produce only the teſtimony of their party: but for this we have not only the Teſtimony of all, which adhere to the Community of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that vaſt body of Chriſtians, which appertain to the <hi>Greek,</hi> Proteſtant, and all the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49823:107"/>Oriental Churches. It muſt be acknowledged, That there was for a time ſome heſitancy in ſome perſons, about ſome part of the New Teſtament. The Chriſtians concerned being diſperſed, and kept by perſecution from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing correſpondencies one with another, could not poſſibly have an information equally early about thoſe Books which were laſt written. Upon this account, when they firſt arrived at their hands, they made ſome demur, as the Apoſtles did at Chriſt, when they believed him to be a Phantaſin: but upon a deliberate view, conſulting with thoſe who had a more perfect intelligence, they corrected the errour of their apprehenſion: Inſomuch, That there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which can be produced of any Church, or Council, which in any Decree, or Canon has diſallowed their Authority.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Theſe Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, have been tranſmitted to us without corruption. We have the atteſtation of all ſorts of men in every age for their paſſage thro' it. Councils have made them the foundation of their Theological diviſions. The Fathers appeal to them in their Concertations, as the moſt equal Arbitrators. Divines before their Homilies prefix a Text taken out of them. The Hereticks in every age, have drawn from them, whatſoever they conceive may favour their Sentiments. <hi>Porphyrie</hi>'s cavils at the Old Teſtament, <hi>Hierocles</hi> comparing the Life of Chriſt in the New, with the Life of <hi>Apollonius, Julian</hi>'s ſpending his Winter-nights in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of it, the <hi>Jews</hi> calling of it a volume
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49823:107"/>of iniquity, argue, That they were extant, and paſſed by them in thoſe ages in which they lived. <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing, and throwing ſtones at <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Bahurim</hi> make it evident, that he went that way.</p>
               <p>As theſe Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have paſſed thro' every age down to us: So in their paſſage they have eſcaped deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What is ſpoken concerning the Eſſential Word, may be applied to the Written. <hi>Thou wilt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Old Teſtament in any point material to Religion has been depraved, it muſt be by the common fate, which all humane Writings are expoſed unto: or elſe out of deſign by the <hi>Jews,</hi> or by ſome unadviſed neglect in thoſe who copied it out.</p>
               <p>Not the firſt way. It is notorious, what a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſcrimination Divine Providence has made betwixt the Scripture, and other Writings in point of conſervation. When the book of the Law was given forth, every Maſter of a family was obliged to have a Copy of it in his houſe. The Prince was bound (as is conceived) to Write it out with his own hand. Every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath it was read in the Synagogues in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the people. Peculiar Perſons were appointed to prevent any mutation in Words or Letters. The <hi>Maſſorites</hi> who began in <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s time, did reckon up all the Verſes, in every Verſe the Words, in every Word the Letters, and have punctually expreſſed, how many times every Word is uſed, and which is the middle Verſe, Word and Letter in every Book. It
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49823:108"/>does not appear, That the like care has been uſed by Divine Providence for the ſecuring any other Book from depravation. The event has been anſwerable to the care. The Writings of the Penmen of the Scripture which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the aid and conduct of their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, have been corrupted, and at laſt are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly periſhed, as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s natural Hiſtory. But what they compoſed by the help of the Divine Spirit, is preſerved in its purity. In all Copies of the beſt account there is a miraculous har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, in all material points. The burning of the Book of the Law by <hi>Antiochus</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the vigilancy of Providence which has been aſſerted. Tho' he was permitted to deſtroy ſome Copies: yet his rage was not ſuffered to reach to all. After this, The <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> in <hi>Maſpha,</hi> are ſaid to lay open the book of the Law, 1 <hi>Macc.</hi> 3.47. This fire made the <hi>Jews</hi> more warm in the defence of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture againſt injurious attempts. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That from this time they began to be more Critical about the Text. That which was deſigned for the ruine of it, was by the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious influence of Heaven, improved into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. The burning the ſacred Oracles, like the burning the Sibyll's books, did make the Copies, which remained, have the greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ſet upon them. From that time the <hi>Jews</hi> divided the Prophets into Sections,<note place="margin">Elia. Tisbi. vo. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and began to read them in their Synagogues.</p>
               <p>As the Books of the Old Teſtament have not been corrupted by that fate, which other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are expoſed unto: So neither deſignedly
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49823:108"/>by the <hi>Jews.</hi> If they had been guilty in this reſpect, it muſt be either before or after the coming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> If before, this crime would not have been concealed in the New Teſtament: The Apoſtle, who has noted That the Oracles of God are committed to them, would undoubtedly have recorded their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs in the diſcharge of their truſt, in caſe any ſuch thing had been. If it be ſaid, That the Apoſtles have ſufficiently diſcovered their thoughts touching this matter, in that they have waved the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text in their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations out of the Old Teſtament, and made uſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion: I anſwer, That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text is never waved; if the words be not directly followed, yet the ſence, which is the Soul of the Text, always is. If the Shell be wanting, yet we have the Kernel. The Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the New Teſtament repreſent the ſence of the Old, in ſuch words, as ſeem meet to the Spirit of God. Thoſe words being of great Authority, were put into the Margin of the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion, as a good illuſtration of it,<note place="margin">Diſſer. in Appen. ad Crit. Sacr. Capelli, p. <hi>489.</hi>
                  </note> and in proceſs of time were inſerted by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers into the Text it ſelf. Several inſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this nature are viſible to thoſe, who diligently peruſe that Verſion.</p>
               <p>If the corruption pretended was made after the Age in which our bleſſed Lord, and the Apoſtles lived, it is very ſtrange, That the Fathers ſhould take no notice of it. They ſpeak of the depravation of the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> It is unaccountable why the Corrupters ſhould ſuffer thoſe Texts to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49823:109"/>continue in the Bible unaltered, which are moſt pertinent for the refutation of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. We deſire no greater advantage againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in our concertations with them, than what the Bible, as it is now pointed, will give unto us. None are able to nominate the Text, where this fraud has been committed. If any ſuch deceit has been uſed, no doubt, but thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> which were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, would have diſcloſed it.</p>
               <p>As the Books of the Old Teſtament have not been corrupted out of deſign: So neither by any neglect of thoſe, which copied them out. He who conſiders their accuracy about Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Law, will not be inclinable to charge them with this crime. They were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the Ink, which they uſed, might have no corroſive ingredients in it. The Parchment, which they wrote upon, was made of the skin of a clean beaſt, and prepared after the moſt exquiſite manner. The Columns were meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and a computation made, how many lines were to be drawn in every Column. Theſe lines were accurately drawn out, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt every word and letter limited. Tho' many of them did remember the Law by heart; yet they did not write a word, till they looked upon it in the Authentick Copy. All this, being duly pondered, doth evidence, That the Books of the Old Teſtament are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved.</p>
               <p>Neither are the Books of the New. In order to the preventing corruption, Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has ſignally appeared in waving the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49823:109"/>of Art, which requires, That thoſe things which are homogeneous be put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in diſperſing the fundamental points throughout the whole Volume. By this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, all attempts to deprave it are eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. If we have ſeveral pieces of money, it is not difficult to know, by comparing of them together, whether any of them have been clipt. If the Truth ſhould be raſed out in one place, yet it will be preſerved in another. It is the pleaſure of the Divine Wiſdom to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the important Articles of our belief, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his flock, that in caſe <hi>Eſau</hi> ſmite the one, the other might eſcape.</p>
               <p>The divine care is equally conſpicuous in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, That Verſions ſhould be made into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Languages, and communicated to the World. Every Nation is in a capacity to hear the Spirit of God ſpeaking in their own tongue. All theſe people living at a great diſtance one from another, could never combine together to corrupt this ſacred Canon. If any ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt had been in any one Nation, the Copies preſerved in others, would preſently have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the fraud.</p>
               <p>The Premiſes being ſeriouſly conſidered, it will be evident, That it is our duty to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Bible, both Old and New Teſtament, as the Word of God, and depend upon it for our primary conduct in Divine Worſhip. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth put it into our hand as a complete Directory in the concerns of Religion. The Teſtimony of the Church doth prepare, and quicken our minds to look into it, and begets
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49823:110"/>a Moral certainty that it is the Word of God. There is no reaſon to queſtion that which has been aſſerted with ſo much unanimity in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. We may as well doubt of that, which we perceive with our ſenſes, as that which has been the ſence of the beſt and wiſeſt of Men at all times. When we are thus prepared, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſult the matter of the ſacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ponder the internal characters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the external Seals of the Verity of them, we find our Moral Certainty preſently tranſlated into a Divine Faith. When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a letter from a friend, we believe it comes from him, becauſe it is ſo aſſerted by the bearer: but when we look upon the hand and ſeal, and find that both are his, we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fently exalted to a higher degree of aſſurance. The inward characters are God's Hand, and the Miracles his Seal. Thoſe who aſſert, We believe the things contained in the Scripture to be True, becauſe God who is True has revealed them: and that we believe God has revealed them, becauſe it is ſo affirmed by the Church in all Ages, make the foundation of Faith weaker than the ſuperſtructure. For the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God is more ſure, than the Univerſal Tradition of Men. Thoſe who aſſert, That this Propoſition [The Bible is the Word of God] is capable of no other evidence, muſt ground their perſwaſion either upon the want of Power, or Will, in God, to impreſs ſuch Characters upon it, as are ſufficient to evidence the divine Original of it. We cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably affirm the firſt. For if by the impreſſions
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49823:110"/>of reaſon upon a diſcourſe, it may be known to be the compoſition of a Man of excellent Learning, why may not ſuch words of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be ſpoken by God, as need nothing to atteſt their Original but their innate evidence? If God may be known by his Works, there is juſt cauſe to believe, that he may be ſo by his Words. He can imprint peculiar Characters upon the one, as well as upon the other. The ſecond cannot be aſſerted. For when he gave forth his Word, he willed that it ſhould be received as his. We cannot receive it as his Word, without a divine Teſtimony. There can be no Teſtimony of this nature but innate evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. If any other revelation be aſſerted, how will it appear that it doth derive its original from God? If from another, the ſame doubt will return, and the enquiry be endleſs. So that if God did Will, That the Bible ſhould be received by us under this notion as his Word, he did Will to impreſs upon it ſuch evidence as is ſufficient to convince every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate perſon. For this reaſon it is compared to light, which doth not ſtand in need of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to manifeſt its reality. Tho' there be many motives to communicate ſtrength to our opinion; yet our Faith properly, is ultimately reſolved into that divine and innate evidence, which has been aſſerted. If we compare it with thoſe ideas of Goodneſs, Mercy and Juſtice, impreſſed upon our minds by a divine hand, and impartially conſider their exact correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, we are ſenſible of a powerful conviction, That the Scripture comes from God, and is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49823:111"/>deſigned for a ſufficient directory in the great and neceſſary concerns of Religion.</p>
               <p>Indeed it's ſaid, That altho' it may be ſo to Men of ready perceptions and elaborate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, yet it doth not follow, that it can be of the ſame conveniency to thoſe who are engaged in ſecular affairs, and have not time to cultivate their minds with ſevere Study and Meditation. To which we reply, That God has ſo placed the neceſſary points of Religion in the Sacred Scripture; That not only perſons of Learning, but very inferiour capacities may arrive at the knowledge of them. What Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy uſes to affirm, concerning the rational Soul, that it is wholly in the whole, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in every part of the body, may be with a greater degree of Verity aſſerted concerning fundamental Truth, which is the Soul of the Sacred Oracles. It is diſſeminated thro' the whole body of the Scripture, and likewiſe it is to be found wholly in many particular parts, which are ſo ſmall, that men of ſecular buſineſs, without any impediment to their particular vocations, may peruſe them, and gain an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of thoſe things which concern their Salvation. I will inſtance in the firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of S. <hi>John.</hi> All things neceſſary to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life are contained in it. He ſays, He writ it, That thoſe who believe in the Lord Jeſus, might know they have eternal Life. This they cannot know by a peruſal of it, except all things requiſite to the obtaining of future felicity be clearly expreſſed in it. Now I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand, why a Man, whoſe ſubſiſtence
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49823:111"/>depends upon his daily labour, may not come to know the ſumm of what is contained in ſo ſmall a volume. It conſiſts but of five ſmall Chapters. He may peruſe them every day: if thoſe intervals only be dedicated to this ſacred purpoſe, which are uſually ſpent about that which is irrelative to his ſecular buſineſs. By this means he may read the whole Epiſtle ſeven times every week, three hundred ſixty five times every year. This frequent peruſal can effect no leſs than a deep impreſſion upon his memory: and if he will ſolicit the Supreme Being to open the Book, and lead him by his Spirit into a right perception of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, there is no doubt he may attain to the knowledge of that which is requiſite to his everlaſting beatitude. If a Letter from an infallible hand, in no clearer a ſtile than the Apoſtle's, ſhould be ſent to one, whoſe liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood depends upon his daily labour, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with a great eſtate that belongs to him, and of the conditions which muſt be performed, before he can be admitted to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment: no doubt he would chearfully apply himſelf to the doing as much as hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and at laſt obtain a right notion of his duty. It is ſlothfulneſs and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not any defect in divine proviſion, that keeps men in their ignorance. If an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to underſtand, what appertains to their future good, be contracted by an ill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, this muſt not be charged upon God, who has amply provided for the inſtruction of the meaneſt in his ſacred Word. Experience
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49823:112"/>teacheth us, how a Mechanick will dive into the myſtery of his Trade, and comprehend all the intricacies of it. Tho' the myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is much deeper in it ſelf; yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the manner of the delivery of it to us in the ſacred Scripture, it is not inferiour in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity to the methods of many profeſſions.</p>
               <p>All this, which hath been ſpoken, doth not ſuperſede the work of the Miniſtery, and render the direction of the Church unneceſſary. Tho' the Bible, in that which has an inſeparable connexion with eternal beatitude, has ſuch a degree of Clarity, that he who is not defective in the uſe of thoſe means, which lie within his ſphere, may be his own Interpreter: yet (by reaſon there is a pronity in all to be ſeduced by their own fancies, blinded by the prejudices of Education, influenced into ſo much obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, as to ſhut their eyes againſt the cleareſt light) The direction, explications and advice of the Church cannot be but of ſingular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and abſolutely neceſſary in this ſtate of imperfection. Men are very backward to hearken to the moſt evident information, in caſe it tends to the abatement of their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions in thoſe ſublunary fruitions and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which they are eſpouſed unto. Tho' the Decalogue, given to the people by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was obvious to every underſtanding right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed, yet, for the reaſon ſpecified, He was pleaſed to give them a <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> in which there is a repetition of the ſame Law, and a fuller explanation of it. Altho' S. <hi>Paul</hi> had acquainted the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the cleareſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49823:112"/>terms with the Goſpel of Chriſt: yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the policy of the God of this World in blinding their minds, he was compelled to write two Epiſtles, to explain and impreſs that which before was fully made known unto them. The cleareſt water may be mudded by impure mixtures. The moſt beautiful Flowers may be obſcured, and overgrown with poiſonous weeds. Let things be never ſo manifeſt in themſelves: yet the Church's help is highly neceſſary in order to the quickning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive faculty, and the removal of all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which may interpoſe, and lie in the way betwixt it and the object.</p>
               <p>The Members of the Church are either Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or Eccleſiaſtical. The Secular have been ſometimes of uſe in this particular. Some of them, like the <hi>Nethinims,</hi> have devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to hew, and make plain, many knotty Texts; and to draw the water of life out of the ſacred Fountain.</p>
               <p>Eccleſiaſtical may be conſidered either alone, or as together in Synods. In their ſolitary capacity they reſemble the Pillars in the way to the Cities of Refuge, erected on purpoſe to prevent thoſe who were flying thither, from ſlipping into by-paths. Their direction is not only an act of Charity but Authority. The Key of Knowledge is committed to them, whereby they have a power to unlock the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and open a paſſage into the true importance of them.</p>
               <p>If we conſider them as congregated in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, ſo their Authority is more illuſtrious. As
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49823:113"/>the Sun of righteouſneſs immediately rules us in the day, that is, in all perſpicuous places of Scripture: So theſe Luminaries are fit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us in the night, in all the dark and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſal paſſages. This we may learn from the holy Apoſtles, who (when the Controverſie, whether God was to be Worſhipped according to the Order of the Ceremonial Law did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace the Church with vexation) were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with the Elders, and in a ſolemn Convention did determine the difference. This was no extraordinary Act, but that which they did deſign to commend to the imitation of the Church, as is evident by the method of their procedure. They did not appeal to any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar revelation, but by rational diſcuſſions, which are common to all men, prepare their way to a deciſion.</p>
               <p>There are Two Opinions of no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency with what has been aſſerted. The Firſt is, That every man ought to be guided by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the concerns of Religion: The Second is, That every one ought to rely upon the conduct of his own Reaſon. Both which we will now examine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be our Guide. If we ask the membes of it about a Guide, they preſently name the Catholick Church. If we interrogate them, what they mean by the Catholick Church, they anſwer, That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity which ſubmits to the Papal Power. If we object the notorious corruptions, which ſtain her reputation, and diſcourage us from putting confidence in her conduct, they reply,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49823:113"/>That her directions are not capable of errour. Her rule is the Word of God. This Word is either written or unwritten: for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Word, which it is, and what is the Sence of it, we muſt depend upon her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation. She is an unerring Judge, an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Guide, and therefore when ſhe propounds her dictates, we have nothing to do, but aſſent.

               <p>If it be ſo, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Infallible; by the Church muſt be meant either the Pope or a Council, or the body of the people which adhere to them, or all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

There was a grave and learned Man, who was not able to endure ſo great an indignity. He was preſently tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as no good Catholick, and was terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, threatned, and perſecuted, that he might approve of things againſt his will. In ſum, Matters were brought to that paſs, by the iniquity of thoſe, that came fitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; that the Council ſeemed not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of Biſhops, but of diſguiſed Maskers, not of Men but of Images, ſuch as <hi>Dedalus</hi> made, moved by Nerves, none of their own. They were hireling-Biſhops, which, as country Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes, could not ſpeak but as breath was put into them. The Holy Ghoſt had nothing to do in the Aſſembly. All the Counſels given there, proceeded from humane policy, and tended only to maintain the Popes immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate

Prieſts muſt not be allowed to marry, becauſe having Wives and Children, their dependence would not be ſo much upon the Pope as the ſecular Prince, under whom they live. Their love to their Progeny would make them yield to any thing, never ſo prejudicial to the Church.

               <p>The Maſs in the Vulgar Tongue muſt not be permitted, becauſe then all would think themſelves Divines. The Authority of the Prelates would be diſeſteemed.

               <p>A Determination muſt not paſs, That the Inſtitution of a Biſhop is from Chriſt, for then it would follow, That the Keys were not given to <hi>Peter</hi> only, and that the Biſhops were equal to the Pope, and a Council above him. The dignity of Cardinals would ceaſe, Reſidence

To theſe intrigues may be added, The Oath of Fidelity to the Pope, (who was a party) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon all the Members of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the continual directions by the mail from <hi>Rome,</hi> the vaſt number of Titulars and Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſent from that Court, with many other devices,<note place="margin">

               <p>As for the People, They can make no juſt plea to infallibility. If the Head cannot juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his plea, much leſs the feet, which are guided by, and take their meaſures from him. If the Head and Members together are the recipients of it, (for it is not agreed, whether the Decrees of the Pope without a Council, or
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49823:115"/>the Decrees of a Council without the Pope, or the Decrees of the Pope and Council without the acceptance of the whole body of the People be authentick. Some ſay one thing, ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Their Language is confounded, that they may be hindred from building the aſpiring tower of Infallibility.) it ought to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how this comes to be known. Two things are alledged, 1. There is a peremptory neceſſity for ſuch a guide. 2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has all the evidence, that can be reaſonably deſired; that ſhe is ſuch a one.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The neceſſity is not apparent. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the doctrin concerning Religion ſhould be revealed by God, the firſt Proponents of it infallibly guided by the influence of the Divine Spirit: but there is no juſt reaſon, why ſuch perſons ſhould be continued in the Church to the end of the World. The certainty of Religion may be ſecured without them. We have an infallible rule to ſteer our courſe by. The Books, in which it is contained, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to our hand, with all the deſirable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, That they are not forged, but really ſuch as they pretend to be. We have as much evidence for this, as the nature of the thing is capable of. The Tradition, whereby they are delivered to us, is ſo univerſal, That could the like be produced for thoſe points, which are in controverſie betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhould not be backward in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of them. We have far leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for many Writings, as <hi>Plato</hi>'s, <hi>Tully</hi>'s, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, which without any heſitancy we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49823:116"/>to be genuine. Theſe are conveyed unto us, but by a very few hands in compariſon: but the Books of the Scripture, being of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concernment, were peruſed by all ſorts, and by this means have gain'd the moſt univerſal atteſtation. <hi>Porphyry</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> with other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies to the Chriſtian Faith, did acknowledge thoſe books to be compoſed by thoſe whoſe names they bear.</p>
               <p>The Books being thus delivered, when we come to conſult the doctrine contained in them, we find ingraven upon it peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Divinity agreeable to the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Deity made upon the Souls of all men, together with the broad Seal of Heaven annexed unto it, many Miracles which God never gives to any a power to do, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming an errour.</p>
               <p>In order to the gaining the true Sence and meaning of this doctrine, we have great advantage from the clearneſs of the ſtile, in all points of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation. Truths of this importance are ſet in a very clear light. What is more manifeſt than the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars: There is a God; a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Worſhip is due to him: in the Deity are Three Perſons. The Second cloathed himſelf with our Nature, that he might be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to tranſact the work of our Redemption. Thoſe that would have a title to the benefits of his Redemption, muſt Believe, Repent, lead a holy Life. An eternal reward will be given to thoſe that do theſe things, and an everlaſting puniſhment inflicted upon thoſe who neglect
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49823:116"/>them. A day is appointed, when all muſt ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe particulars, with many others of a-like nature. are written with the greateſt perſpicuity. If any complain of obſcurity, it is in themſelves, and not in the object. If men will deveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their prejudices, diſſipate thoſe miſts which are caſt before them, they cannot remain long unacquainted with theſe Truths.</p>
               <p>If any controverſie ariſe, we have viſible Guides to adviſe with, who are devoted to the ſtudy of the Sacred Oracles, and ſolemnly ſet apart by a Divine appointment to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: even as in ſecular concerns there is not only a Law to walk by, but Men wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the ſearch of the meaning of it, who are able in difficult caſes to aſſiſt us. Tho' theſe Perſons, whether alone or congregated in a Synod, are not infallible: yet when they are duly improved, ſincerely Religious, free from the Bias of an irrelative intereſt, they give us a high degree of aſſurance, That their thoughts are agreeable to Truth, and juſt Reaſon, if we cannot internally aſſent, to keep our Faith to our ſelves, and not to diſturb the Peace of the Church, by an imprudent publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>We attribute to the Divine Spirit, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the holy Scripture, ſupreme and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Conduct: To the Governours of the Church, Subordinate and Miniſterial: To pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men, who are under their Government, we dare not deny the judgment of diſcretion. God requires of them a reaſonable Service,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49823:117"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> a compliance as is in brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are entirely ſubject to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who uſe them, and can give no account of the action they are directed to. He expects the concurrence of the Heart. He has endued us with a freedom to determine our ſelves, and requires that our election be made upon ſuch evidence; that in caſe our Rulers command us to do otherwiſe, than we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be right, we may be able to give a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber account of our diſſatisfaction, an anſwer to every one, that asketh us a reaſon of the hope, which is in us, with meekneſs and fear. We are obliged to prove all things, try the Spirits whether they be of God. This Exhortation is not directed only to Fathers and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the Church; but ſuch as are ſtiled young men and children, who are under their conduct.</p>
               <p>This liberty in point of diſcretion doth not leſſen and impair the certainty of Religion. Thoſe, who uſe it, have a rational power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them by the Supreme Being for the ſearching and finding out of Truth. They have viſible Guides to make their application to, in order to the removing their ſcruples. They have the enjoyment of the publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, which by Heaven is deſigned as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means to convey information to them, the promiſe of the divine Spirit, which doth accompany it, and will be aſſiſtant to them, if they do not reſiſt it but expoſe themſelves to its operations, a power to ſuſpend their aſſent, till the matter be clear and evident. When
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49823:117"/>the object is ſo, and the faculty duly prepared by the uſe of ſuch means, as have been ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will be unreaſonable to aſſert, That we may in ſuch circumſtances be impoſed upon. He to whom veracity is eſſential, made the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. He formed it with a deſign to find out Truth: He requires no other condition in any object, to qualifie it for aſſent, but clearneſs. We have as much clearneſs in all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, as the nature of the thing will bear. So that in this caſe we have a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the divine Veracity and Goodneſs, with which it is no reconcileable; That our faculty ſhould be ſo formed, as to be deceived, when the Propoſition, we aſſent unto, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and perſpicuous. So that the ultimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of our Faith is not made into the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible teſtimony of a private Spirit, but a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given by an infallible attribute of the immutable nature of the Deity, which aſſures us not only, That what God has revealed, is true: but that thoſe things are revealed by him in the Bible which are plain and manifeſt to a duely qualified mind.</p>
               <p>Errour proceeds from the giving too haſty an aſſent to propoſitions upon ſuch grounds as are irrelative to their Nature, as Education, Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He who will deveſt himſelf of his prejudices, which way ſoever contracted, and ſincerely apply himſelf to the uſe of ſuch means as are of Divine deſignation, as Praying, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hearing, Meditating, conſulting the living Guides, which God has ſet up in his Church, will certainly arrive at the perception of that,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49823:118"/>which is neceſſary to his Salvation. He has the higheſt degree of aſſurance, that this ſublunary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

No acquieſcence in it could be obtained, but upon ſuch conſiderations, as now induce us to believe the Bible, and the clear ſence of it, to be the Word and mind of God. All this will evidence, That there is not a peremptory neceſſity for ſuch a Guide as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> contends for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not true: That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has all the evidence, that can be reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that ſhe is ſuch a one. Three Topicks are commonly made uſe of in this caſe, Scripture-promiſes, Univerſal Tradition, Motives of Credibility.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, Let the Text be cited, where any ſuch promiſe is made to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> is ſo far from inſinuating any thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that he gives them advice, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently imports the poſſibility of their fall. He acquaints them, if they boaſt againſt the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, (as it is manifeſt they have done) and grow inſolent, that they ſhall be cut off. To mention thoſe promiſes, which reſpect the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church, is wholly irrelative. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo far from being the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that ſhe is but a part exceedingly dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. <hi>Peſſimum acetum ex optimo Vino.</hi> She
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49823:118"/>hath obtained the title <hi>Catholick</hi> by the ſame method, which <hi>Abimelech</hi> uſed, to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King, and <hi>Phocas</hi> Emperour. She attempts to murder the right Heirs, and true Sons of the Church, with the unjuſt imputation of Hereſie; that ſhe may enjoy the inheritance alone. Her deportment has been, as if one member of the body which has a diſtemper in it, ſhould value if ſelf upon that account, and pronounce all the other parts to have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the whole, becauſe they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it. Indeed it is ſaid, That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church is <hi>One</hi> and always viſible, which can be applied to none, but the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this may as eaſily be denied as affirmed. She has not been in any age, the One only Church. The Eaſtern Churches have had always an exiſtence, as well as the Weſtern: in which from the firſt age there has been the Baptiſm of Chriſt, the Creed of the Apoſtles, an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of Biſhops. In the Weſtern, when abuſes began to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there was always a number not only of private, but publick perſons which gave their teſtimony againſt them, as will be manifeſt to any who have leiſure to peruſe the Hiſtory of the Ages, betwixt <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Theſe perſons we have more reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Church, which God has promiſed always to preſerve, than thoſe who were willing without any reluctancy to ſubmit to the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt innovations. Tho' they were not equal in number, yet there were enough of them to make the little flock, to which a Kingdom is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:49823:119"/>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is now, has not been always viſible. There was no ſuch thing in the three firſt Centuries. Where was then the doctrin of Supremacy, Infallibility, Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, worſhipping of Images, Invocation of Saints, Praying in an unknown Language, keeping the Scripture from the People, mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacrament, making the Apocryphal Books equal to the Bible? Theſe are ſome of the Characteriſtical notes of the preſent Church, whereby ſhe ſtands diſtinguiſh'd from others. Thoſe Ages were utterly unacquainted with theſe Tenents. We dare appeal from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is now, to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as it was then, and ſtand to her arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. In the following Ages, errours began more to ſhew themſelves, yet they did not grow to ſuch a height, as to be received for the Faith of the Church. The infernal Spirit has been always buſie to ſow his tares: yet thoſe Ages were not ſo blind, as to take them for wheat. Inſomuch that we lawfully ſay, That there was not a man in thoſe days, which may be properly called a Papiſt.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> which reſpect the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church; the utmoſt that can be made of them, is, That there ſhall always be upon the Earth a people owning the fundamentals of Religion, together with Teachers, which ſhall have a ſufficient aſſiſtance in order to the directing and inabling them to diſcharge their duty. But there is no aſſurance given, that this aid ſhall be ſo efficacious, as to furniſh them with ſuch an univerſal Infallibility as the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49823:119"/>Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to. Such help is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, as is ſutable to the exigencies of every Age. In the Primitive, it was neceſſary, That it ſhould be ſo powerful, as to ſecure the firſt Proponents of our Religion from errour. But in after ages this neceſſity did not continue. Greater skill is required to make an exact rule, than when it is made, to draw a line exactly conformable to it. The foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being completely laid, and the rule of Faith and Worſhip given out by an unerring hand, ſuch aid only is ordinarily to be expected as (if we be not wanting to our ſelves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the effects of it by a voluntary neglect) will lead us into the ſence of what is revealed. God has endued us with a faculty, whereby we are in a capacity to make a free choice of that which is propounded unto us. He helps us to do it by ſuch means as are agreeable to an intellectual nature. He does always enough to enable us to make an advantagious election: and therefore errour is charged in ſacred Writ upon the Will, as the original of it.</p>
               <p>This doth not render Religion uncertain. Fallibility and certainty are not inconſiſtent. There may be an actual certainty, where there is no abſolute infallibility. A Judge is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and yet he may be certain, that the ſentence which he pronounceth, is right. A man may be ſure of what he ſees plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated before him, altho' he is not out of the power, and influence of all deception. When a foundation is laid, and ſome build gold, ſilver, and precious ſtone upon it, others
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49823:120"/>wood, hay, ſtubble, it is as eaſie for one who is not infallible to diſcern the difference betwixt theſe ſuperſtructures, as to diſtinguiſh a wall of marble form that which is made of brick. If there be no certainty without infallibility, Scepticiſm muſt be admitted, and a ſtop put to all proceedings of Juſtice. No Man ought to be condemned to ſuffer a penalty, except it be certain, that he deſerves it, and who are there, but fallible Men to give evidence, and judge of his demerits?</p>
               <p>If the Promiſes of Scripture have ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> ſence as is contended for, how comes it to be known? It is a received principle amongſt thoſe with whom we are concerned, That they cannot be ſure of the meaning of the Bible without the interpretation of an infallible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and by conſequence we muſt be ſure, that the Church is infallible, before we can be ſure of the Sence of Scripture: and if ſo, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe cannot be alledged as an argument to prove infallibility; for then there will be a perfect circle. The ſence of the promiſe is juſtified by the infallibility of the Church, and the infallibility of the Church by the ſence of the promiſe. From hence it is apparent, That the meaning of the promiſe may be known without the interpretation of an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit: and if ſo, why not the ſence of other places of Scripture?</p>
               <p>If we ſhould enter upon an examination of the particular Texts of Scripture, which are pretended to favour the Infallibility which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> contend for, they would be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49823:120"/>found no way anſwerable to that purpoſe for which they are produced. They are ſuch as theſe, <hi>If he neglect to hear the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lo I am with you to the end of the world. He will guide you into all truth. He that heareth you, heareth me. It ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us. The Church which is the pillar and ground of Truth. He, that will not hearken to the Prieſt, ſhall die. Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this rock will I build my Church. I have prayed, that thy faith fail not. Feed my Sheep.</hi> To all which, we briefly anſwer in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we are commanded <hi>To hear the Church,</hi> This Church may be the <hi>Greek,</hi> or Proteſtant, as well as the <hi>Roman:</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> doth not imply the infallibility of it. Every Pariſhioner is commanded to hear the Miniſter which is ſet over him, and yet no body from thence will infer, that he is infallible. This Church, we are not to believe without making any ſcrutiny, but lie under obligation <hi>to try all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi> The command of the Church doth not free us from ſin in our conformity to it. The <hi>Jews</hi> contracted a deep guilt in compaſſing the death of our bleſſed Lord, tho' they did it in obedience to their Governours. Not only Paſtors, but the Sheep know the voice of their ſupreme Shepherd, and are in a capacity to diſtinguiſh it from the voice of a ſtranger.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When it is ſaid, <hi>I will be with you to the end of the world,</hi> This aſſures us of the preſence of Chriſt with his Miniſters, ſo long as the world endures: but not that he will give the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49823:121"/>ſame meaſure of aſſiſtance, which the Apoſtles did enjoy. That which is ſufficient in every Age is aſcertained by this promiſe: but not that which is efficacious to ſuch a degree, as will ſecure them from all errour; for then every particular Paſtour will be as Infallible as every Apoſtle was.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When it is aſſerted, That when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth is come, <hi>He will guide you into all truth,</hi> it cannot be proved, That this promiſe is made to any beſides the Apoſtles. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text plainly appropriates it to them. I have many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Theſe words have an evident aſpect upon the Diſciples only. If we ſhould grant, That not only the Apoſtles, but their Succeſſors, are the objects of the promiſe; what is intended to be proved, will not follow, namely, Infallibility. The direction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be oppoſed. He gives in all ages a ſufficient, but not an irreſiſtible guidance. Many, tho' they are put into a right way by him, yet deſert it, and follow their own er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous apprehenſions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe words, <hi>He that heareth you, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me,</hi> are ſpoken of the Seventy Diſciples, not aſſembled in a Council, but as going up and down from place to place to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. So that if they be conſtrued in ſuch a fence as to favour Infallibility, they will prove more than is deſired, namely, That this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of not erring belongs to every Preacher, who has a lawful authority conferred upon him to publiſh the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:49823:121"/>5. Thoſe words, <hi>It ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us,</hi> do not argue, That the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit will infallibly aſſiſt in all future Councils. They aſſert what was done at this preſent Convention, but hold forth no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the ſame degree of aſſiſtance in all Ages. The reaſon of this extraordinary aid was peculiar to thoſe times. The Apoſtles then were to lay the foundation, to fix an unerring rule, both for the converted <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The rule being once ſetled, the neceſſity of the continuance of the ſame degree of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance did ceaſe. The Heavens did forbear to rain down Manna, ſo ſoon as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in poſſeſſion of a Country furniſhed with all convenient proviſion. It is no good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; That becauſe the Sanhedrim in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s time was endued with an extraordinary Spirit, therefore the ſame favour muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to all their Succeſſours, even to the Council, which put the Lord of Life to death.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In thoſe words, <hi>The Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of Truth.</hi> The word <hi>Church</hi> muſt import, That in which <hi>Timothy</hi> is directed how to demean himſelf, and that undoubtedly was the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of which he had the Eccleſiaſtical inſpection. That Church did hold forth the True Doctrin of the Goſpel in its publick Profeſſion: even as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars upon which the Edicts of Princes are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, expoſe them to the view of all that paſs by. The expreſſion alludes to the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> much celebrated for its magnificent Pillars, upon which the rules of the Religion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49823:122"/>of that Goddeſs were inſcribed. The Apoſtle intimates, That thoſe Columns were the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of falſhood: but the Church of Chriſt, in the City, the Pillar of Truth, holding forth the True Doctrin of Heaven. The words do not ſpeak the indefectibility of that Church, but the preſent ſtate only. This Pillar began to decay in <hi>Domitián</hi>'s time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. and is at this day utterly demoliſhed.</p>
               <p>If it be granted, That the words under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration have an aſpect upon the Univerſal Church, no advantage will from thence accrue to the plea for Infallibility. She is not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as the ground and pillar of all Truth, but of Truth in general, which may be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that which is fundamental. Tho' ſhe cannot fail in this particular, (for then ſhe will loſe her eſſence, and ceaſe to be) yet ſhe may in other points very uſeful to be known.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>Truth,</hi> we underſtand all Truth, the words may ſet forth the duty of the Church, what ſhe ought to do, and not the actual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, what ſhe always does. When the Diſciples are ſtiled <hi>the ſalt of the earth,</hi> this doth not argue an invincible quality in them whereby they are ſecured againſt the danger of loſing their ſavour; but a conſtant obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them to retain it, and ſeaſon others with it.</p>

                  <hi>That man that will not hearken to the Prieſt ſhall die,</hi> no advantage will from thence redound to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> except he can make it appear, That He is Succeſſour to the High Prieſt under the

                  </note> This is a common caſe in all Communities;<note place="margin">In ſuperbia;</note> where there is no ſuch thing pretended to, as Infallibility. When a cauſe is under debate, and the Law requires the laſt appeal to be made to the Supreme Authority, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerned ſo to do, turns his back upon it, arrogantly refuſes a ſubmiſſion, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence evidently endangers the Peace and Security of the whole Community, this is a fault of the firſt magnitude, and juſtly deſerves the moſt ſevere animadverſion. If it could be proved, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil called by him has as good Authority over All the Churches of the World, as the high Prieſt with the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had over the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Tho' from thence it would not follow, That he is exempt from errour, yet none would doubt to aſſert, That his power is not to be treated with contempt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That Text, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> is no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49823:123"/>to the Infallibility contended for, than thoſe, which have been already conſidered. It is not agreed, Whether by the Rock is to be underſtood <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, or Jeſus Chriſt who is ſtiled a Rock, or the confeſſion which <hi>Peter</hi> made. The ancient Fathers incline to the two laſt. If they be preferred, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can from thence reap no advantage. If we ſhould grant, That S. <hi>Peter</hi> is the Rock ſpoken of, it will not argue any Infallibility promiſed to him: but the declaration of a Divine purpoſe to make him a firm and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful inſtrument in the propagation of the Goſpel, as the reſt of the Apoſtles were, and many of their Succeſſours. Here is nothing peculiar to S. <hi>Peter.</hi> The other Apoſtles are repreſented to be as intimately concerned in the foundation of the Church, as he. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.14. The following words, <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> rather prove, That the Church ſhall never ceaſe to be, than any univerſal indefectibility. It is certain, That, there ſhall be a Church upon the Earth, teaching all truth of peremptory neceſſity to Salvation, until the coming of our bleſſed Lord: But that it ſhall be exempt from errour in all matters of Faith, is contrary to experience. It was once received as a truth, That Infants ought to have the Euchariſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to them; and now it as unanimouſly exploded for a grand miſtake.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Prayer of Chriſt, <hi>That the faith of</hi> Peter <hi>might not fail,</hi> argues rather, his not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally falling away, than a total exemption
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49823:123"/>from errour. He was under great miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions after theſe words had been ſpoken to him. He believed, That Chriſt would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue upon the Earth, and in thoſe dayes reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not to be called in, and made partakers of the like priviledges with the <hi>Jews.</hi> If it ſhould be granted, That the Petition of our Lord did ſecure an Infallibility to <hi>Peter,</hi> this would be of no advantage to our adverſaries in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent controverſie. It cannot be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is concerned in all the Prayers which were made for S. <hi>Peter.</hi> There is in them no mention of any Succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſour. If there had, it would be difficult to prove, That the Pope is the perſon. Some doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. <hi>Peter</hi> was ever at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ſilent in this matter. The firſt Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were but of a mean reputation. Many figments were deviſed to ſupport the credit of their relation. The common fame, which by degrees did grow out of theſe beginnings cannot be accounted a demonſtration, ſo long as there are Catalogues of errours which not only the Vulgar, but Perſons of Learning have been ſurpriſed with. To erect Infallibility up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a fluid foundation, is, as if an attempt ſhould be made to build a Caſtle in the Air. If S. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and left the Biſhop of that place to ſucceed him, this might be only in his ordinary power, and not in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary qualifications, as perſonal Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, a power of doing Miracles. There is as much reaſon for the Pope to challenge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49823:124"/>the laſt as the firſt: and yet I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he pretends to it. The Miracles in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are uſually attributed to ſome perſons, that cannot eaſily be ſpoken with, in order to the knowing the truth. If this power had been aſcribed to the Pope, daily experience would have given the Aſſerters a flat contradiction.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Thoſe words, <hi>Feed my ſheep, &amp;c.</hi> do not import the conferring upon <hi>Peter</hi> any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above the reſt of the Apoſtles, but only the inſuring to him his intereſt in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Commiſſion given to them. They were commanded to teach all nations. It might lie as an objection againſt him, That he was not included in the number of thoſe, who were thus commiſſioned. By his denial of Chriſt he had in appearance forfeited his right to the Apoſtleſhip: as <hi>Judas</hi> by betraying him fell really from it. To give him and others aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, That he was one who by a Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment (notwithſtanding his notorious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage) was to joyn with the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in teaching all Nations, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt, as many times <hi>to feed his flock,</hi> as he had denyed him. All this will make it evident, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has no promiſe made to her in the Scripture of Infallibility.</p>
               <p>As for Univerſal Tradition; That will be as hard to be found, as a Scripture-promiſe. It imports, the delivery of this doctrin from one age to another ever ſince the Apoſtles times, and an acknowledgment and reception of it
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49823:124"/>in all places by all true Chriſtians. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars cannot be reconciled with ſuch a Tradition. Many Hereſies did emerge in the firſt Ages, by which the Church was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſquieted. Yet we never read in any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Record, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſummon thoſe which adhered to them, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his infallible Conſiſtory. If any ſuch Judicatory had been then known, it is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, he ſhould ſo far neglect his duty, as not to attempt the reducing of them to a ſober and orthodox mind by his unerring Authority. The Biſhops of that Church lived ſo near the Apoſtolical Age, that they could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the power which Chriſt had left with them; and they were ſo pious, and good, that it would be a manifeſt injury to their memory, to think that they would not exert it in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch importance. If theſe Hereticks were ſummoned, (altho' no ſuch thing is rè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded) and did refuſe to ſubmit to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is pretended, it is unaccountable, how it comes to paſs that <hi>Irenaeus, Epiphanius, Theodoret,</hi> who have compoſed Catalogues of Hereſies, with which the Church was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, ſhould be ſo forgetful as not to reckon That in the number which thoſe were guilty of, who would not acquieſce in the ſuppoſed Authority. This is now reputed an errour of the firſt magnitude. All others are eſteemed but trifles in compariſon. If it had been ſo accounted then, it would not have been paſſed by in ſo profound a ſilence.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:49823:125"/>
               <p>The <hi>African</hi> Biſhop's denial of a compliance with <hi>Sozimus, Boniface,</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine: Cyprian</hi>'s refuſal of a ſubmiſſion to <hi>Stephanus, Irenaeus</hi>'s oppoſing the decree of <hi>Victor,</hi> do manifeſtly declare, That they knew nothing of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is pretended. Had they been acquainted with it, their integrity would not have ſuffered them to be engaged in ſo much diſreſpect towards the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> apply themſelves to preſcribe the beſt method, how to prevent the ſpreading of Hereſie, they ſpeak not one ſyllable of an infallible Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory at <hi>Rome.</hi> If it had been known in their days, no doubt, they would not have failed to mention it, as the moſt ſovereign expedient. If a Man ſets himſelf to write a Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beſt way how to cure the Plague, and knows of one infallible remedy, it is not conſiſtent with the rule of common honeſtly to paſs it by in ſilence, and to entertain his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with ſome uncertain conjectures.</p>
               <p>It was anciently decreed, That Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhould be determined in the Province where they did ariſe. If it had been believed, That there was then ſuch an Oracular Judge, as is now aſſerted, this had been a very unjuſt decree. What can be more injurious, than to oblige men to acquieſce in the deciſion of thoſe who may impoſe upon them, when they might (if left to their liberty) have had recourſe to one, in whom there is no poſſibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception?</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:49823:125"/>
               <p>A belief of this infallibility would have drawn ſuch reſpects upon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> That no other would have dared to account himſelf his equal: and yet S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> treats him in ſuch terms, as plainly import a parity. He ſtiles him, <hi>Frater, Collega, Co-epiſcopus,</hi> S. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſays, That all Biſhops are of an equal merit, and the ſame Prieſthood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are, whether at <hi>Rome, Eugubium, Conſtantinople, Rhegium, &amp;c.</hi> In the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Letters no more reſpect is expreſſed to him, than to others. The primacy which is ſome times ſpoken is not of juriſdiction, but order. He living in the City, where the ſeat of the Emperour was, when he did convene with other Biſhops, ſome regard was ſignified upon the account of his relation to that place, but none upon the account of any Infallibility and Oecumenical juriſdiction, which he was believed to be inveſted with. When applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made to him by thoſe who were in diſtreſs, it was not done with an opinion, That he was inſpired with an unnerring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to determine their caſe: but becauſe he was of the ſame Sentiment with them, and had great advantages, by reaſon of his reſidence in the Imperial City, to procure their relief. What he did in favour of ſuch perſons, as S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> was not done juridically, but declaratively. He did not act as an authorized Judge, but a ſincere and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Friend to that Truth, for which they were oppreſſed.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:49823:126"/>
               <p>The infirmity of theſe pleas for Infallibility makes the Defenders at laſt'to fly to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Credibility, as the ſecureſt Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>The chief of them are Antiquity, Diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Amplitude, uninterrupted ſucceſſion of Biſhops, agreement in Doctrin with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, union of Members, holineſs of Doctrin, efficacy of Doctrin, holineſs of Life, the glory of Miracles.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould enter upon a particular exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of theſe, they would be ſo far from proving the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> infallible, that they will not amount to prove her a True Church.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in thoſe points, which are peculiar to her, is not ſo ancient as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The novelty of thoſe things, in which ſhe differs from the reformed Church, is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly manifeſt: as Supremacy, the Worſhip of Images, Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When ſhe has ſcrew'd every thing to the higheſt pin, it will not appear, That any point of difference was, before the Myſtery of Iniquity began to work.</p>
               <p>Diuturnity, may with as much efficacy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to believe, That the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are a True Church; for they have been a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years in the world, much longer than ſome Articles in the <hi>Roman</hi> Creed.</p>
               <p>Amplitude may as well prove the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of <hi>Rome</hi> Apoſtatical, as Apoſtolical, Antichriſtian, as Chriſtian. Antichriſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as <hi>ſitting upon many waters,</hi> and thoſe Waters are interpreted, <hi>people and multitudes,

I know, that it will be ſaid, That all theſe are cut off from the Church by Hereſie. But the beſt way to try, whether it be ſo or no, will be to examine the Confeſſions of their Faith, and compare them, with the unerring rule of Scripture. Upon an impartial inquiry, it will be found, That the worſt of them has a much better conſiſtency with the Primitive Standard, than the Creed of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> has. The greateſt fault which is found with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> is their compliance with the advice of S. <hi>John, Little children keep your ſelves from Idols:</hi> with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> The believing the words of our

                  </note> altho' they retain their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from <hi>Jacobus Sanzalus,</hi> a defender of the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereſie, yet they renounce his doctrin. <hi>Leonard,</hi> Legate of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, in thoſe parts of the World, where the <hi>Jacobites</hi> live, hath recorded, that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49823:127"/>their Patriarch profeſſed to him, That tho' indeed they held but one perſonate nature in Chriſt, reſulting of the unity of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not perſonated: yet they acknowledge thoſe two natures to be united in his perſon without any mixtion and confuſion: and that they themſelves differ not in underſtanding, but in terms from the <hi>Latin</hi> Church. From all this it is evident, That the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have no reaſon to inſiſt upon their amplitude, as a character of the Truth or Infallibility of their Church.</p>
               <p>the next Motive, is the uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Biſhops; by which is meant the coming of one Biſhop into the place of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from S. <hi>Peter</hi> to the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> without the interpoſition of any unduly qualified. Such a Succeſſion they are never able to demonſtrate. For thoſe who are rightly qualified according to their own Principles, muſt be no Symoniſts, no Schiſinaticks, no Hereticks, Men and not Women. And yet it is confeſſed, That ſome of them have obtained their dignities by Symoniacal contracts, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, <hi>Sextus</hi> the Firſt. Others have been under the guilt of Schiſm. The Council of <hi>Piſa</hi> depoſed <hi>Benedict</hi> the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth under that notion, and elected <hi>Alexander</hi> the Fifth, who continued in the place without depoſition. the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> depoſed <hi>Eugenius</hi> upon the like account: And yet after the Council was ended, he recovered his dignity without any Conciliary Act: And from him all to the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49823:128"/>preſent Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> are deſcended. So that whether the Pope be above a Council, or the Council above the Pope, the Succeſſion is interrupted.</p>
               <p>Some of them have been under the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereſie. <hi>Liberius</hi> was an <hi>Arrian, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtaſius</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian, Vigilius</hi> an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> and it is believed by ſome, That one of them was a Woman: For this we have the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of all the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> till <hi>Luther</hi>'s time. They were ſo ingenuous as to confeſs the thing, till the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> began to urge it to their prejudice. To all this I may add, That thoſe Churches, which have as good a Succeſſion as they contend for, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding branded with the infamy of Hereſie; as our own, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Succeſſion, which is only perſonal and not doctrinal, can be no motive to induce us to believe, That they are a True, much leſs an Infallible Church.</p>
               <p>As for their agreement in Doctrin, with the ancient Primitive Church, This would be a motive indeed, could they demonſtrate any ſuch harmony. Till they have reconciled their Doctrin of withholding the Cup from the Diſciples of Chriſt, with the words of our Saviour, <hi>drink ye all of it.</hi> Concerning Prayer in an unknown Tongue, with the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>If I pray in an unknown tongue, my underſtanding is unfruitful:</hi> Concerning the Worſhipping of Images with the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Primitive Chriſtians not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſo much as the making of them, we
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49823:128"/>ſhall not eaſily believe that there is a conſent in all things, betwixt their doctrin and the doctrin of the ancient Apoſtolical Church.</p>
               <p>The next Motive is the Union of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers amongſt themſelves. He who well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Schiſms betwixt the Anti-Popes, as <hi>Novatianus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius, Foelix</hi> and <hi>Liberius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> and <hi>Damaſus, Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Sylverius, &amp;c.</hi> with many others: Six and Twenty in <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s account, Thirty according to <hi>Onuphrius;</hi> and thinks fit to enlarge his Meditations with the conſideration of the diviſions betwixt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Popes, the laſt pretending a power from Chriſt to deveſt the former of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and with the differences betwixt the Popes and the Biſhops about their Power, Whether it be derived immediately from the Pope or from Chriſt, the Biſhops and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, theſe pleading an exemption from their juriſdiction, the Regulars and the Parochial Prieſts, with all the diverſities betwixt the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> and <hi>Moliniſts, Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans,</hi> the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> and the followers of the doctrin of <hi>Lombard</hi> and <hi>Anquinas,</hi> together with the grand conteſt about the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article, <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſome making it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, ſome abſolute; ſome ſaying it is in the Pope, ſome in a Council, will not find himſelf under any ſtrong inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; That the Concord ſo much boaſted of, is ſo perfect, as is pretended. Indeed, they ſay, Tho' they be not actually agreed, yet they have the moſt ready way that leads to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49823:129"/>it. They all acknowledge one viſible Head, in whoſe judgment all are to acquieſce; So that when differences ariſe, they have nothing to do, but to ſpeak with him. But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. For the Motive is not potential but actual Union; not what may be, but what is. It is no good conſequence, that they are United, becauſe they have a way, whereby they may be brought into Union. When the parts of a Watch are aſunder, they cannot be ſaid to be in conjunction, because there is a hand which is able to put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Moreover, it is not true, That they have ſuch a certain way to Unity. It is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed where the unerring Spirit reſides. The Pope, who makes the moſt confident pretence to it, doth frequently decline a determination. When the parties on both ſides are great, he is in fear, leſt he may give diſtaſte to either of them: and ſo make it his choice not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their Union, but to couch down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two burdens. Some times his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations are delivered with ſo much ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity, That the perſons concerned are no near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a reconciliation than they were before. His decrees like the anſwers of the Oracle, are ſo flexible, that they may be bent into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with every humour. His Council at <hi>Trent</hi> was no ſtranger to this kind of policy. The ſence of ſome Decrees was ſo doubtfull, That <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Riſt. of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>un. p. <hi>229, 230.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>Catharinus,</hi> both preſent, did, during the Seſſion, publiſh Books one againſt the other concerning the meaning of them. Were their way to union, and the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49823:129"/>product of it, as perfect as they pretend, yet it could be no motive to induce us to believe their Infallibility. A Unity of the greateſt elevation cannot exceed that, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the four hundred Prophets in the time of <hi>Ahab,</hi> or betwixt thoſe who make war with the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13. The infernal Spirit well knowing that his kingdom, if divided, cannot be aſſured of any permanency, uſeth the utmoſt of his activity to unite his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>The next inducement is Holineſs of Doctrin. This can be no Motive, if we impartially ponder the following particulars.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us to be unjuſt towards God, and to alienate the Worſhip which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to him, and give it to the creature. The religious addreſſes made to Saints departed this life, Images, the Bread in the Sacrament, are evident demonſtrations of this injury.</p>
               <p>It is highly prejudicial to the rights of his Vicegerents. Divers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Councils have declared, That the Pope may abſolve Subjects from their Allegiance, and deprive Emperours and Princes of their Dominions. Several crimes are reckoned up by approved Authors, which render Princes obnoxious to this condemnation, and the Pope himſelf is made Judge, whether they are guilty of the crimes they are ſuſpected for.</p>
               <p>It is deſtructive of True Devotion. This cannot be in Prayer, except the will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be engaged. And the will cannot be rightly concerned and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to what is Prayed for, except it be duely informed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49823:130"/>the matter of the Petition. True Zeal in the will is always the product of light and knowledge in the underſtanding, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect can have no diſtinct knowledge, if Prayer muſt be made in an unknown tongue, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It gives encouragement to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched life. According to the Papal Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, a man of a lewd converſation, after he has ſpent his days in the gratification of his exorbitant luſts, if at laſt, he applies himſelf to a Prieſt, expreſſing a ſorrow ſpringing from a fear, That the badneſs of his life may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to everlaſting torment, and obtains his Abſolution; (which will of courſe be granted) he ſhall certainly be freed from eternal pains: and as for temporal, which are not remitted, but muſt be inflicted in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, he may in a great meaſure eſcape them too, if he be ſo rich, as to leave mony enough behind him to oblige the Church to ſo much Charity, as to help him with their ſuffrages, and to celebrate frequent Maſſes for him: So that it is hard for none, let them be never ſo exorbitant, (except they be poor and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent) to obtain a quick diſmiſſion out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>The next Attractive is the Eſſicacy of their Doctrin.</p>
               <p>The Doctrin amongſt them, is either ſuch as is common to all Chriſtians, or proper to their Community. The Eſſicacy of the firſt, is a good evidence of the reality of Chriſtian
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49823:130"/>Religion: but no demonſtration of the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of <hi>Rome.</hi> The prevalency of the ſecond is not ſo conſpicuous as is pretended. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of multitudes to the Papal Yoke is to be imputed to the efficacy of ignorance and tyranny, and not to any tranſcendent virtue in their Faith. Had not there been better metal in their ſwords than their doctrine, they would not have proſelyted ſo many <hi>Americans,</hi> as they did. The Inhabitants of that part of the World did not apply themſelves to the Prieſts, as the Regions of <hi>Judaea</hi> did unto <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, but they were driven like herds of Cattle to the watering place. They were not perſwaded, but by the moſt direful hoſtility affrighted into Religion. Their reſentments of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> cruelty were ſo great; That they made it their choice to kill themſelves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the avoiding of it: and could not be prevailed with to deſiſt from this inhumanity, until it was told them, That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> likewiſe intended to kill themſelves and to follow them into the other World, and there be as great a torment to them,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> as they had been in this. In the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> where their Power was leſs, their Policy was greater. They finding there a people very ſtiff in the maintenance of their Idolatry. They did not truſt to the efficacy of their Doctrine to work conviction in them, but devised an expedient, how they might make them good Chriſtians, and yet let them retain their old Religion.<note place="margin">Myſt. Jeſ. Let. <hi>5.</hi> p. <hi>83.</hi>
                  </note> They enjoyned them to hide under their cloaths an Image of Jeſus Chriſt, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49823:131"/>to direct their publick adorations to it, which in outward appearance were terminated upon the Idols <hi>Chacim-coan,</hi> and <hi>Keum-fucum.</hi> Had they been aſſured of any eminent efficacy in their Doctrine, they would not have heen ſo prodigal of their reputation, as to ſtain it by the uſing ſo prodigious a method.</p>
               <p>As for Holineſs of Life, When they make this a Motive, They mean either the internal or external part of it. The firſt cannot be a motive of credibility, becauſe it is not ſeen: the ſecond may be diſſembled. The infernal Spirit may put on <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Mantle. This Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs which is ſo much boaſted of, muſt be either in the lives of the body of the people, or elſe of ſome ſelect branches, or elſe of the infallible Head.</p>
               <p>The firſt cannot pretend to it. Debauchery no where more prevails, than where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Religion is entirely received.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond, I am not ignorant That great things are ſpoken of ſome ſelect perſons. <hi>Bartholomaeus de Piſis</hi> has not been afraid to compare <hi>Franciſcus</hi> to Chriſt,<note place="margin">Lib. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</note> and in ſome things prefer him. His Sanctity has brought ſuch a reputation to his Order, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believed, That no man can be damned, who dies, having his body wrapped up in a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> habit.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Dominicus,</hi> it is conſidently affirmed; That he never committed mortal ſin, from the day of his Birth. <hi>Ignatius</hi> (they ſay) was ſo much in favour with God, That he talked with him, as he did with <hi>Moſes</hi> face to face.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49823:131"/>Yet for all this boaſting, He that will impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially view the Lives of theſe Perſons, and ſome others, as they are repreſented by their own party, and put all their external ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties together, will find, they differ as much from true Holineſs, as <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s paint from <hi>Eſther</hi>'s beauty.</p>
               <p>As for the Heads of the Papal Community, ſome of them have had no more Sanctity than the Pillars which upheld the Houſe, where the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were gathered together. Their Pride, Murders, Uſurpations, and all kind of debauchery and inhumanity gives ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence to this truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pride. <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third could give himſelf no contentment, till he obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi> an univerſal Supremacy, and changed the Apoſtolical <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, into the Imperial <hi>Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; Jubemus. Theodatus</hi> decreed, That <hi>Maurus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> ſhould not be honoured with the rights of Chriſtian burial, becauſe he refuſed to ſtoop to the See of <hi>Rome. Conſtantine</hi> the firſt, was pleaſed ſo far to humble himſelf, as to let <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the ſecond enjoy the honour of kiſſing his feet. <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, made <hi>Henry</hi> the ſourth, with his Empreſs and Son, to wait three days bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed in the extremity of Winter, before he would vouchſafe to give them Audience. <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth was highly diſpleaſed with the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt, becauſe he did not hold his Stirrup on the right ſide. <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond, ſet his foot upon the neck of the ſame Emperour, uſing theſe words,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49823:132"/>
                  <hi>ſuper Aſpidem &amp; Baſiliſcum.</hi> By his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Fourſcore Laſhes upon his bare back, for his miſdemeanour, in the caſe of <hi>Thomas Becket. Innocent</hi> the third, by his Legate <hi>Pundolphus,</hi> made King <hi>John</hi> kneel down, and reſign up his Crown, which the Legate did keep five dayes. This tranſcendent humility has appeared more or leſs in moſt of them. It was not peculiar to <hi>Zachary</hi> the firſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and condemn <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> for maintaining their exiſtence. None of the Popes could with any degree of Patience endure to hear of any which did walk oppoſite to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Murders. <hi>John</hi> the Twelfth poiſoned <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> to make way for himſelf to the Papal dignity. <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſs than Six or Seven in order to the accompliſhment of the ſame purpoſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was Pope, he hired a miſcreant to roll down a ſtone upon the head of the Emperour as he was at Prayers. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the third, raiſed the quarrel betwixt <hi>Peter of Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Charles of France,</hi> which occaſioned the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Veſpers. <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth, had a hand in compaſſing the death of Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the father of King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Scotland. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the thirteenth, procured the bloody Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> and teſtified his approbation by publick Triumphs at <hi>Rome.</hi> When <hi>Clement</hi> had murdered <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth applauded the act, in a Speech to his Cardinals. His carriage in it reſembles the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49823:132"/>motions of a Cat when ſhe is poſſeſſed of her prey. Sometimes throws him up, as though he had a mind to extol him, and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently throws him down again, with the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Hereſie. Some times he runs back from him, as though he was affrighted with ſo inhumane a ſpectacle; and then comes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again, and by purring over he expreſſeth the higheſt degree of ſatisfaction. When <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaillac</hi> had ſtabbed <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> the Abbot <hi>du Blois,</hi> who inveighed againſt the Jeſuits, and expreſſed himſelf, but as the nature of the thing required, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by many ſpecious pretences, to take a journey into <hi>Italy,</hi> and when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> was impriſoned and murdered. If the death of this great Prince had not been highly pleaſing to his Holineſs, ſo loyal a Subject would not have been treated ſo unkindly upon his account.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Uſurpations. <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded fealty of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and when the King had returned his anſwer, That he would give him none, becauſe he had never promiſed it, nor did he find, That his Predeceſſors had ever performed it. He ſent a Letter to <hi>Hubert</hi> his Legate, in which he complained, That none of the Pagan Princes ever preſumed to attempt That againſt the Apoſtolical See, which the King had done without bluſhing. <hi>Paſchalis</hi> made the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, and received as peremptory a denial. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49823:133"/>Biſhops not to anoint the Son of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: which inſolency the King ſo highly reſented, That he cauſed all his Subjects from Twelve years old, to Sixty, to abjure the Pope's Obedience. <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, upon a diſtaſte taken in the time of King <hi>John,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his Uſurpations, commanded, the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors in <hi>England,</hi> for ſix years to be ſhut, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service to be laid aſide, the Bodies of the Dead to be carried into the field, and tumbled like dogs into ditches without Chriſt an Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. Theſe encroachments were ſo favourably thought on in theſe dark times, That the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, to make the way more facile to his depoſition, raiſed a report, That <hi>John</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> had abſolved his Subjects from their allegiance. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Arundel,</hi> That he might with the greater eaſe deveſt <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the ſecond of his regal dignity, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Pope's Bull, promiſing remiſſion of ſins to all, who would ſtand for <hi>Henry</hi> againſt him.</p>
               <p>The People in thoſe days had generally drank ſo deep of the Cup of the fornication of <hi>Rome,</hi> that when they looked upon the Supreme Power, they ſaw double, and fanſied one Sovereign in their own Country, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, I might add to what has been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (but that I take no delight in repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch deformities) all manner of Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Debauchery. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> plucked out the eyes of divers of his Cardinals, and cut off their hands, for inclining to <hi>Otho</hi> the great.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49823:133"/>He defloured <hi>Raynora,</hi> ſet Houſes on fire, drank a health to the Devil. <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> ſtole away the Church-Treaſure. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> provided for his Concubine <hi>Tyreſia</hi> Shooes covered with Pearl, builded Stews at <hi>Rome. John</hi> the <hi>23d.</hi> flea'd a Biſhop, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards burnt him, becauſe he had given him ſome diſtaſte. <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, took mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of <hi>Bajazet</hi> to murder <hi>Gemes</hi> his Brother, who ſled to him for protection. He defloured his own daughter <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and gave himſelf to the Devil. <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> told Cardinal <hi>Bembus,</hi> That Religion was but a profitable Fable. <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> proſtituted his ſiſter to the luſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, that he might be made Cardinal, and committed inceſt with his daughter <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> poyſoned her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, That he might have the freer enjoyment of her.</p>
               <p>He who thinks fit to conſult <hi>Platina, Onu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrius, Bellarmine, Baronius,</hi> and the Hiſtory of the Popiſh Treaſons and Uſurpations with ſome others, which repreſent the Lives of the Popes, will ſee, That I have done them no injuſtice. By all this it is viſible, of what ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation Holineſs has been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and what little reaſon there is, to make it a motive of Credibility.</p>
               <p>The laſt is the glory of Miracles. By Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles we muſt underſtand Works which are above the power and energy of finite Nature, and are plain and evident to the Sence. None but God can effect them, and when he doth them, they are produced openly, and all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49823:134"/>are ſo perſpicuous, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any reaſonable ſuſpicion of colluſion. Such were the works of Jeſus Chriſt. They are confeſſed by all to be above the energy of finite Nature, whether Angelical or Humane. All the Angelical Powers, had they conſpired together, could not, by the ſpeaking a word, have raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, after he had been four days in the grave: or in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cured Chronical diſeaſes which had been upon the diſtempered perſons, ſome Twelve, ſome Eighteen, ſome Thirty Eight Years. Theſe effects were produced in the cleareſt light. The Sun of righteouſneſs did not light a candle to operate by. They were done not only before friends, who might be byaſſed with inclinations to uſe their Microſcopes, and magnifie every thing beyond its juſt dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but in the preſence of the moſt impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable enemies, who were under the ſtrongeſt propenſities to eclipſe the glory of them.</p>
               <p>Now we cannot learn, That ſuch Miracles as theſe, are done by the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> Many, which are pretended to, are diſcovered to be meer colluſions. Thoſe that they ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to glory in, have not much evidence as is neceſſary to the nature of a Miracle. They tell of wonders, done by the remains of S. <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Compoſtella</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> by the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Loretto</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> in her <hi>Santa Caſa:</hi> by the Sacred Vial of S. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in S. <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>'s Church in <hi>France:</hi> But when we come to inquire not only into the Truth of what is pretended to be done, but likewiſe for the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49823:134"/>evidence which they have, That the Vial in the Church of S. <hi>Maximine</hi>'s was <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s, and the blood boiling in it upon the Paſſion-day the blood of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: or, That the <hi>Santa Caſa</hi> at <hi>Loretto</hi> is the Chamber where the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was born, and ſaluted by the Angel: or, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques at <hi>Compoſtella</hi> are the real remains of S. <hi>James:</hi> Their account is ſo defective, That all Wiſe Men of their own party are aſhamed of it. The beſt Teſtimonies, they have, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreams or viſions and fables, deviſed by Men wholly devoted to the advancement of their own deſigns. There is a Table in the Church at <hi>Loretto</hi> in no leſs than Thirteen Languages for the edification of all Nations, in which is given an account of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the <hi>Santa Caſa</hi> by Angels. The whole certainly reſolves it ſelf at laſt into a dream, a viſion, and the talk of two old Men.</p>
               <p>The beſt Evidence for the Miracles of <hi>Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verius,</hi> are ſome poſthumous relations framed after his death. He himſelf in ſeveral Letters, in which he makes a Narrative of his tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt that People, ſpeaks no ſuch matter. <hi>Franciſcus de Victoria,</hi> ſays, That he could hear of no Miracles which were done in thoſe parts by the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome.</hi> Fabulous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions ſerve to buoy up the devotion of the common people. Their Zeal for ſuch publick Tales, is uſually of the ſame elevation with that of <hi>Demetrius</hi> for his gainful Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. If it ſhould be granted, That Miracles have been done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49823:135"/>is no aſſurance, That the deſign of them is to confirm the Infallibility which that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity pretends unto. Miracles in the Goſpel, are like Fines in the Common Law, they have Deeds to lead them, and declare their proper uſe. There is no authentick declaration from Heaven concerning this matter. We have more reaſon to think, if any ſuch Miracles have been done, That God by them did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the confirmation of the Truth in which Proteſtants and Papiſts do agree, and not the corrupt Additions, about which they differ. When a Miſcellaneous People planted in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> by the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> did not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>Jehova</hi> according to his own order, and God in a miraculous manner, ſent Lyons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them to deſtroy them; it would have been very unreaſonable in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to have aſſerted, That this Miracle was done to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Idolatrous Worſhip of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel:</hi> Whereas God had his eye, not upon the juſtification of the corruptions, which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſtained with, but ſo much of the Truth as was retained by them.</p>
               <p>When the Papiſts have made the utmoſt, of what they can, of their pretended Miracles, they will find every jot as good amongſt thoſe, whom they will be very unwilling to grant to be infallible. <hi>Falſe Chriſts ſhew great ſigns, Matt.</hi> 24.24.

This may be ſufficient to evidence, That the glory of Miracles can be no motive to induce us to believe, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible in her conduct in the concerns of Religion.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this particular concerning the motives of Credibility, I will lay down ſeveral on the other ſide, which may juſtly incline us to think, That no ſuch guide was ever intended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no where revealed by Jeſus Chriſt. If he had committed his Univerſal Church to the guidance of any one viſible, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Head, certainly it would have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the holy Bible. It is a matter of great importance, not to be ſetled in doubtful expreſſions. No Prince, who appoints ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his abſence to govern his Subjects, does it in ambiguous terms: but gives him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in ſuch clear words, That no man can have any juſt reaſon to diſpute his Authority.</p>
               <p>The Texts uſually pretended to countenance ſuch a Guide, as is contended for, have been already examined, and found inſufficient.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49823:136"/>There is more in that expreſſion relating to S. <hi>Paul</hi> [<hi>That which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the Churches</hi>] than in any thing which is ſpoken of S. <hi>Peter:</hi> and yet no man pretends to collect from thence; That S. <hi>Paul</hi> was excluſively an Oecumenical Biſhop, and the final deciſion of all points in Religion did belong only to him and his Succeſſours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such a Guide, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would have, who muſt be followed blindfold, and his dictates received with an implicit faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, is not conſiſtent with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Intellectual Being. Our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is appointed to be our immediate Guide, inſomuch, That if we act contrary to it, we pervert the order of Nature, and vitiate the action. It is deſigned by a divine inſtitution to make ſcrutiny and ſearch into that which is propounded to us. Therefore when there were infallible guides upon the Earth, the people were commanded to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the facred Oracles, and make tryal by them of what was tendered to them. They were not to rely only upon the words of them, who ſpake, but examine their Authority by a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rule, and inquire into the ſence of what was ſpoken by them.<note place="margin">Joh. <hi>5.</hi> Act. <hi>17.11.</hi>
                  </note> Our bleſſed Lord directed the <hi>Jews</hi> to take this courſe, and the <hi>Beraeans</hi> are commended for the uſing of it. To ſuffer our underſtandings to be lapped up in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite belief, is to keep our talent in a napkin. Our Intellect was given to us to be exerted to the uttermoſt, that all the Acts of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might become a reaſonable Service.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:49823:136"/>3. Such a Guide is deſtructive of true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Acts of Religion, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is defined by the Philoſopher, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an elective habit. It diſpoſeth us, when good and evil are ſet before us, to make a free election: to chuſe the good and reject the evil. Now the Guide ſuppoſed, who muſt be followed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcrutiny, deprives us of this liberty. He muſt be believed, whatſoever he propounds, whether right or wrong. If he commands us to believe that to be black, which appears white to our ſence, we muſt not diſpute his dictate. Amongſt the Eighteen rules of the prevailing Order in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Thirteenth runs in theſe words, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ipſi Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae Eccleſiae omnino unanimes conformeſque ſimus. Si quod oculis noſtris albus apparet, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum illa definierit, debemus itidem quòd ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum eſt, pronunciare. Bellarmine</hi> is very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this rule, as is manifeſt by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſion, <hi>Si autem Papa erraret, praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendo vitia, vel prohibendo virtutes, teneretur Eccleſia credere vitia eſſe bona, &amp; virtutes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, &amp;c.</hi> If the Pope ſhould err in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vices or prohibiting Virtues, the Church would be obliged to believe, Vices to be good and Virtues evil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such a Guide can be of no advantage to us in our preſent circumſtances. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready an infallible Rule to walk by, the true ſence of which, if we receive and comply with, we cannot err. Now this ſence may as eaſily be obtained, as the ſence of an infallible, Guide. If there was ſuch a one, as is ſuppoſed, he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49823:137"/>could not be ſpoken with by one of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of thoſe who are concerned in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his determination. And therefore they muſt receive it from the relation of others: or by ſome Writing under his hand. The Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors being fallible, and obnoxious to the like infirmities with other men, can give us no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſurance. They may be byaſſed with partiality and irrelative reſpects. A Writing from him is liable to the ſame exceptions, which are uſually formed againſt the Scripture. We ſee that all parties among the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend favour from the determinations of the Church. They are like Pictures, which ſeem to look upon every one in the room, where they hang. When intereſt is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will find out as many evaſions, as the moſt ſubtle Adverſary can deviſe to elude any text of Scripture. There are many diviſions among the <hi>Romaniſts:</hi> yet all aſſert, the ſence of the infallible Judge is on their ſide. Why may not we as well underſtand the ſence of the Bible immediately, as the meaning of a Decree in Writing of ſuch a Judge. The Scripture was written by an unerring hand, with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere purpoſe, that it might be underſtood. Clearneſs of ſtile is a neceſſary condition in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this end, and therefore muſt be deſigned by the Compoſer. God undoubtedly is able to write with as much perſpicuity, and with as manifeſt accommodations to the meaneſt capacity as men are. Thouſands have had ſo firm a Faith grounded upon the ſence which they immediately derived from his Word,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49823:137"/>That rather than they would depart from it, they have with alacrity endured the loſs of their ſublunary comforts, and chearfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up their lives to the inhumanity of their Perſecutors. The Divine Spirit is ready to aſſiſt thoſe who are ſincerely deſirous of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Peculiar perſons are devoted to the ſtudy of the Scripture in order to the diſſipating of Clouds, and the clearing of what is obſcure. Why a Writing compoſed by an infinitely Wife Being, and attended with theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, in order to the gaining the true meaning of it, may not be as eaſily underſtood as the decrees of a Pope, or the Canons of a Council, I could never diſcern any good reaſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such a Guide is not reconcileable to the Divine Intention, in giving us the ſacred O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Theſe are evidently deſigned as a rule, which every one is obliged to conſult. <hi>Bleſſed is he which readeth, Rev.</hi> 1.4. Reading is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in order to the gaining underſtanding. <hi>Let the word dwell richly in you in all wiſdom.</hi> The ſupreme Head of the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to ſearch the Scriptures. S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> (whom the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> aſſert to have been his Vicegerent upon the earth) requires us to attend unto them, as unto a light, without ſuggeſting the neceſſity of having recourſe to himſelf or his Succeſſors for interpretation. All this aſſures us, That we are to take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from the Bible, and judge for our ſelves, what is to be done or not done with a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion, that our conformity to the Divine Will, may be an act of our Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:49823:138"/>
               <p>Now a Guide, whoſe Dictates we are to ſwallow down without examination, is not conſiſtent with the practice here enjoyned us. To be bound to examine the rule with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; and yet to reſign up our ſelves to the decrees of a Guide about the ſence of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſcrutiny, are two contrary obligations. If the firſt be intended, (as it is plain it is) the laſt cannot. God never wills, that we ſhould be engaged to thoſe things which are contradictory one to another. In a civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; where there is a Law and a Judge: If it be commanded, That every Subject read this Law, ſearch it diligently, uſe his beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to underſtand it, That his conformity to it may be an act of his own Reaſon, this would plainly ſignifie, That the Judge is not to be followed blindfold, whether right or wrong, but his Decree is to be compared and fully conſidered. Tho' the Judge has the power of deciſion, which the ſubject is ſo far to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in, as not to diſturb the publick order by any inutinous demeanour: yet the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcretion cannot be denied to him in this caſe, which if it happens to be contrary to the ſentence of the Judge, he muſt bear without a tumultuous deportment the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. All the Teſtimony we have, That ſuch a Guide is intended, is from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the party concerned, and lays claim to this Dignity. If we ask how it comes to be known, that the is veſted in this immunity, Scripture-promiſes are preſently alledged. If
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49823:138"/>we further demand, How we ſhall know, that this is the ſence of the promiſe? We are told, That we muſt adhere to the interpretation of the Church, which underſtands it ſo. From which it evidently appears, That the ultimate ground and reaſon of our belief in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, is the Teſtimony of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For no Community is permitted to have the denomination of a true Church, beſides that which ſubmits to the Papal Authority. If our Bleſſed Lord, the ſupreme Head of the Church, ſays, <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true, Joh.</hi> 5.31. Much more may this be applied to the Body, if it has no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for this fundamental point, but what is derived from her ſelf. The bare teſtimony of a party is not a ſufficient foundation to build a legal determination upon in any Court of Law.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Primitive Conſtitution of the Church plainly intimates, That no one Guide was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be Supreme over all the Churches in the World. Our bleſſed Lord left the Apoſtles in a parity. Nothing was ſpoken to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> concerning any Eccleſiaſtical Power, but what the others were equally concerned in. Theſe conſtituted Biſhops over particular Churches in the ſame equality, they themſelves were left in. Tho' in every Church there is a ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of the Clergy and People to their own Biſhop, yet there is none to any, which is foreign. It is true, There is one Catholick Church, but the unity of it conſiſts in having <hi>one Lord, one Faith,</hi> and <hi>one Baptiſm,</hi> and not
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49823:139"/>one Biſhop and Head to interpret for all, and impoſe what dictates he pleaſeth upon them. The antient Churches did maintain correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies by Communicatory Letters; and when extraordinary caſes did emerge, ſend their prudential Expedients as the effects of their Charity: But we no where read of the exerciſe of any pretended authority one over the other. If there had been any one autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed Guide in controverſie for all Churches known in thoſe early times, when Hereſies and Schiſms did ariſe, no queſtion, a ſpeedy application would have been made to him, for the curing of what was amiſs: yet we read of no ſuch matter. But on the contrary, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals were prohibited to any foreign Biſhop, and an expreſs order eſtabliſhed, That diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſhould be decided within the Province, where they did emerge. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> aſſerts ſo much in his Epiſtle to <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>55.</hi> Pamel. Epiſt. <hi>59.</hi> Oxon.</note> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Nam cum ſtatutum ſit omnibus nobis, &amp; aequum ſit, &amp;c.</hi> For when it is appointed to all of us, and it is both equal and juſt, That the cauſe of every one ſhould be heard, where the crime is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and a portion of the Flock is aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to particular Paſtors, which every one muſt rule and govern, being under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to give an account to the Lord of what he does: It behoves thoſe, whom we are ſet over, not to run up and down, nor break the firm concord of Biſhops by their ſubdolous and fallacious temerity, but there to plead their cauſe, where the Accuſers may have witneſſes of their crime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> The fifth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49823:139"/>of the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> is of the ſame importance, and is ſo interpreted by the next General Council held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the ſecond Canon.</p>
               <p>As for the Canons of the Council of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica,</hi> which ſeem to favour Appeals, there is juſt reaſon to ſuſpect, that they are forged. The Fathers of the ſixth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> knew nothing of them, tho' about Forty <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Biſhops were preſent at that Convention, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> teſtifies. A matter of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not have been concealed from them, when ſo many of their own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were witneſſes to what was tranſacted. The attempt that was made to father them upon the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> argues, That there was no fair dealing about them.</p>
               <p>If the Canons are genuine, it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, That they were made, not by a General, but a Provincial Synod. Tho' the Council was intended to be General, yet it proved otherwiſe by the Oriental Biſhops withdrawing themſelves, and refuſing to act in it. The decrees of ſuch a Convention have not efficacy enough to reſcind and annul what was done before in the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> An Inferiour Authority cannot aboliſh, what is eſtabliſhed by a Superiour.</p>
               <p>If the Council had been General, yet if we look well into the Canons pretended to be framed by it, they will not amount to that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thinks to make of them. Three things are conceded to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of that See, 1. A liberty in caſe of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49823:140"/>already given, to deliberate, whether the matter ought not to be conſidered again. 2. If he thought ſo, whether he would ſend any to be preſent at the hearing of the Cauſe. 3. A freedom to appoint Judges out of the neighbouring Provinces finally to determine. Here is no bringing the cauſe to <hi>Rome,</hi> but the judgment is to be ended, where the difference did begin.</p>
               <p>If all this was as real, as it is pretended to be, it cannot be looked upon as any more than a prudent Expedient in that preſent juncture. The <hi>Arians</hi> very much prevailed. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox were highly oppreſſed. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> favoured their cauſe. And to put him into a greater capacity of ſuccouring them, ſuch a determination might be condeſcended unto. But the words of the Synod plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it as a novel thing, which the Church before was utterly unacquainted with. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Inſtitution of Chriſt, nor Primitive Tradition are alledged as the ground of it: but an honorary reſpect to the memory of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> being at that time eſteemed as his Succeſſour, and very ſtedfaſt in that faith which he ſacrificed his life for, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, are the words of <hi>Hoſius</hi> of <hi>Corduba,</hi> who is repreſented as the perſon, who did ſteer all matters under debate in that Convention.</p>
               <p n="8">8. No proviſion is made of one infallible Guide in a caſe of like importance. The whole World is one Community under God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the Church is one under Chriſt. All
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49823:140"/>particular Kingdoms are united under ſome general Laws, as the ſeveral Churches are in the ſame rules of Belief and Worſhip. They have all the ſame light of Reaſon. There is a <hi>jus Gentium</hi> to which all the Empires of the Univerſe are obliged to ſubmit. Peace is as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable betwixt them, as Unity amongſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the Church. The records of every Nation give an account of the direful effects of Civil as well as Eccleſiaſtical diſcord. From hence ariſeth the moſt deſolating Wars, and the ſudden ruine of millions of Men, who are taken off in the heighth of their fury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have time to ſettle their thoughts in relation to eternity. How are the innocent ſtript of their enjoyments, and have nothing left them but a deplorable ſtate of Miſery. All this by inevitable neceſſity tends to the eclipſing the honour of the Supreme Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, the glory of his regiment being much more conſpicuous in a peaceable order, than a polemical confuſion. The image of the Sun cannot be diſtinctly ſeen in troubled waters. For this important reaſon, we are under the ſtricteſt obligations to follow peace with all men, and mutually to exchange acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humanity. Altho' Peace betwixt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Nations be of ſuch great moment, yet it is not the pleaſure of the Supreme Rector to conſtitute one viſible infallible Guide for the conſervation of it. If this was a means of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory neceſſity, in order to the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unity and Concord; there is as much reaſon, why it ſhould be appointed for the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49823:141"/>ſecuring Unity in the ſeveral Kingdoms of the World, as the ſeveral Churches. No ſuch conſtitution being made in relation to the preſerving their amicable correſpondencies, no argument can be drawn from the nature and neceſſity of the thing, that it muſt be eſtabliſhed in the Church.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If the Church has one ſuprme Guide veſted in an authority to decide all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, it will not be eaſie to reconcile this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to the conſtitution of Civil Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. The Militant Church cannot have an exiſtence, but within the territories of ſome ſecular Sovereign Power. The Prince is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly inveſted by God, with authority to preſerve the Peace of his Community. This Peace is often diſturbed by Eccleſiaſtical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. If he has not a power within his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, (without addreſſing to foreign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) to compoſe them; He has an end appointed to him, and yet is not allowed the uſe of the means which immediately condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to it. All things may break out into a combuſtion, and the Community be entombed in its own aſhes, before the deciſion of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power can be obtained. It would not be accounted any diſcretion, when a Prince's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is on Fire, to refuſe the uſe of the River which runs by it: and ſend into <hi>Italy</hi> for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in order to the quenching of it. Every Sovereign within his own Dominions is the Supreme Moderator and Governour, in all Cauſes as well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil; which cannot be, if there be one authorized Guide,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49823:141"/>for all the Churches in the World, to whoſe determination they are bound to ſubmit, let it be never ſo contrary to the Will of their own Sovereign. Tho' Secular Princes have not a Power <hi>in Sacris,</hi> that is, to Ordain, Preach, Adminiſter the Sacraments, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they have an undoubted Authority, <hi>circa Sacra,</hi> that is, to defend the Church in the doing of theſe things, and ſee that the Governours rightly proceed in their adminiſtrations: and when controverſies ariſe, which have a tendency to trouble the State, to convocate them, and ratifie ſuch reſolutions, as conduce to the ſecuring the concord of the Community. Tho' the Church is immediately conſtituted by Chriſt: yet it cannot be denied, That Secular Princes, within whoſe Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it is planted, are deſigned as Nurſing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to it, which muſt neceſſarily import their duty, to ſee, That Poiſon be not adminiſtred inſtead of Milk, to cheriſh it, and put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to thoſe moleſtations, which will hinder the growth of it. If this power be veſted in every Prince, there can be no foreign authorized Guide, who has right to command within his Dominions. Theſe two conſtitutions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to the other, and inſtead of Peace muſt neceſſarily produce War. Subjects would not know to whom to pay their Allegiance, whether to ſubmit to the Sword or the Keys. Whereas if there be a power within every Nation, to reform it ſelf, and to put a period to all differences without the interpoſals of a foreign authority, the publick Peace is ſecured
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49823:142"/>as much as can be expected in this ſublunary ſtate.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There is a plain prediction in the holy Scripture concerning one who will pretend to be ſuch an infallible Guide as we ſpeak of. He is deſcribed, as ſitting in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>That he is God.</hi> God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly infallible, and therefore he who <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Temple,</hi> namely the Chriſtian Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. and carrieth himſelf as God, doth make a manifeſt claim to that indefecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that is peculiar to the Deity.</p>
               <p>This Pretender to infallibility is repreſented to be a great Impoſtor. He is ſtiled <hi>the man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Character which is given of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor exactly agrees to him, who now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be ſuch an Authorized, Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Guide.</p>
               <p>He is deſcribed as one profeſſing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: as making a great defection from the reality of it: as ariſing out of a low condition: as having his growth in greatneſs impeded for a time by the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: as exalting himſelf by degrees, (as that obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was removed) above Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and all that is called God: as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with outward pomp and ſplendor: as, having his Seat in the City upon ſeven Hills: as treating thoſe with the greateſt ſeverity, who refuſe a ſubmiſſion to his Sentiments: as come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all power, ſigns and lying wonders.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:49823:142"/>
               <p>How agreeable this Character is to him who now pretends to be an infallible Guide in the concerns of Religion, is undeniably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. He is in profeſſion a Chriſtian, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to maintain the whole Doctrine which was delivered by our Bleſſed Lord. He is guilty of a great defection from it, by mixing many injurious additions with it, and declaring all to lye under the guilt of Hereſie, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to comply with them. He was in a low condition, ſo long as the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire ſtood in its full force, and power. He ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſtiled himſelf, <hi>indignum famulum Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris.</hi> As the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> decayed, ſo he encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and at laſt grew to ſuch a heighth, as he challenged an authority over Princes and all that is called God. He made bold to depoſe them, to abſolve their Subjects from their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, to diſpence with the Laws of Heaven, and make them ſubſervient to his worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. He is attended with all outward ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and glory. He is not contented with a ſingle Crown, but aſſumes a Triple. He expects the moſt ſolemn adoration from thoſe who apply themſelves to him. When the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of <hi>Sicily</hi> proſtrated themſelves at his feet, uſing theſe words three times,<note place="margin">Molin. vates.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> he was not diſpleaſed with the civility of the addreſs. The place of his reſidence is in the City built upon ſeven Hills. He uſeth thoſe, which diſſent from him, in the moſt ſavage and cruel manner. Miracles are one of the ſigns of that Church which he is the Head of.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:49823:143"/>
               <p>Indeed it is ſaid, That the man of Sin is the ſame with him, who is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and he is expreſſed to be one, who denies the Father and the Son; which cannot be affirmed of him, who is the great pretender to infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility. To which we reply, That tho' he owns them in words, yet in reality he denies them, by authorizing that Worſhip which is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them, to be given to created Beings. Tho' a Subject does verbally own his True Sovereign; yet if he pays that homage to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which is due only to him; he does in truth deny him, and will be treated by the Law as ſuch a perſon. Actions are more faithful indications of the mind, than verbal expreſſions.</p>
               <p>As all this argues the agreeablenſs of the Character of the Man of Sin to the great pretender to Infallibility: So we know of no other, to which it can with ſo much reaſon be applied. Three are pretended to have an intereſt in it. <hi>Caius Caligula, Simon Magus,</hi> and a <hi>Jew</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> He cannot be the perſon. Tho' he was a Man of Sin, yet he was not the Man, which the Apoſtle had his eye upon. He was come and gone before the writing of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Baronius Capel. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. aed Hiſtor. Apoſto. p. <hi>3913.</hi>
                  </note> which was about the end of the Ninth, or the beginning of the Tenth year of <hi>Glaudius</hi> his Succeſſor: and we muſt not ſo interpret S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as to make him propheſy of that which was already paſt. The ſame exception lies againſt <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> He was in his altitude and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:49823:143"/>greatneſs about the beginning of <hi>Claudius.</hi> His flying in his fiery Chariot, and being brought down headlong by the Devotion of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> are uſually believed to have happened about the Second Year of his Reign, about Eight Years before the Prophecy was extant. The Man of Sin was hindred from appearing in thoſe times by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the Secular Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> aſſert. The firſt calls it <hi>Romanum Statum,</hi> the ſecond <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The third <hi>Romanum Imperium.</hi> This was not taken away till ſome Hundreds of Years after: and then the great pretender to Infallibility did diſplay himſelf in his proper colours. Indeed the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity began to work in the Apoſtles dayes. There were then many Antichriſts. As Chriſt had his Types to repreſent him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Manifeſtation in our Nature: So had his great Antagoniſt. In the number of theſe, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> may be reckoned: but to make him the perſon which the Apoſtle has in his eye, in his prediction concerning the Man of Sin, cannot be reconciled to any good reaſon.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is ſaid, That a <hi>Jew</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> is the Perſon aimed at by the Apoſtle, who will aboliſh the Maſs, oppreſs the Church, ſubdue the whole World in Three Years and a half; and then preſently ſhall be the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt to the laſt judgment. But this is as eaſily denied as affirmed. There is not the leaſt intimation of any ſuch matter in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>49.</hi> Num. <hi>2.</hi> Jer. <hi>8.</hi> Rev. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> The Texts, which have been ſometimes produced, are ſo irrelative, That
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49823:144"/>the wiſeſt of our Adverſaries are aſhamed to alledge them. The Perſon which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle aims at, muſt be a Chriſtian in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who in reality makes a great defection from the Doctrine of our Saviour: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſſerted of a <hi>Jew,</hi> who is, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an open and profeſſed enemy to it. There is an impoſſibility in the thing, That one ſhould ſubdue all the World in Three Years and a half. It would be very difficult for him to viſit every part (tho' very well mounted) in ſo ſhort a time, much more to conquer it. In the times immediately preceding the laſt day, there will be worldly joy in the greateſt altitude, Eating and Drinking, Marrying and giving in Marriage, which cannot be conſiſtent with that Sorrow, which muſt be an inevitable product of the univerſal oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tyranny of an inſatiable Conqueror. It does not appear, That there is any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for any ſuch matter in any part of the Univerſe. The Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> (for any thing we know) is utterly extinct. There is not a <hi>Jew</hi> now, that takes his denomination from it. It is ſtrange, That the Myſtery of Iniquity ſhould begin to work in the Apoſtles daies, and now altogether ceaſe to make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. The infernal Spirit is as active, as ever. It is his chief deſign to ſet up the perſon, whom the Apoſtle deſcribes. He cannot be imagined to be wanting in his endeavours to accompliſh ſo grateful a purpoſe. The <hi>Jews,</hi> to requite the Advancers of this Hypotheſis, ſay, That Antichriſt ſhall be begotten in <hi>Rome,</hi> and his name called <hi>Armillus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Buxt. Rab. Lex. in voc. Armillus.</note>
               </p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:49823:144"/>
               <p>Hitherto I have conſidered, the firſt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be our Guide. The Second is, That this priviledge belongs to every Man's Reaſon. By the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of every Man, we muſt underſtand, That Light which every one has in his Intellect. Tho' this be the immediate Guide, yet it is not the Supreme: and is no farther valuable for conduct in Religion, but ſo far as it is conformable to the Supreme Rule. This rule is the revelation of God contained in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. This was given to be <hi>a Lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our paths.</hi> Thoſe Texts which reſpect our Salvation, and promiſe to us a ſecurity againſt the revenger of blood, like the Cities of Refuge in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon Hills, and made very conſpicuous. There is no need of Four Hundred Camels (as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpeak) loaden with Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to give them light. Matters of Faith and Worſhip neceſſary to the enjoyment of a future ſtate of happineſs, are clear in them.</p>
               <p>When it is ſaid, That every Man muſt be guided by his own reaſon; if the meaning is, That he muſt be ruled by the light of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, from whatſoever Topic it is derived, without any limitation, many ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will be unavoidable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such conduct will neceſſarily produce an effect very diſagreeable to the mind of the Supreme Being. If it be allow'd, there will be as great a diverſity of opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Religion, as there is of tempers, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49823:145"/>and intereſts. Theſe uſually mould the Intellect, and make the moſt prevailing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon it. From hence commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Light which the generality pretends unto.</p>
               <p>This variety will certainly ſuffocate the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſtian love. Men in their ſeveral apartments are naturally propenſe to meditate their own defence, and the juſtification of their ſeparation. They uſually believe, That the moſt compendious way to it, is to weaken the reputation of thoſe, who differ from them. This creates on both ſides the hotteſt jealouſie, the moſt ſiniſter interpretation of each others acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, an exchange of the greateſt unkindneſs, and an utter ſuffocation of thoſe breathings of Charity which the primitive Age was ſo eminent for. So long as diviſions are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of ſuch bad effects, it is impoſſible that the Divine Nature ſhould be atoned into an approbation of them. This is the reaſon of the Apoſtle's pathetical entreaties to ſpeak the ſame thing to avoid diviſions, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly joyned in the ſame mind and judgment. Not only a unity amongſt religious perſons is required in this, That every one act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Conſcience; but that every perſon have the ſame judgment and conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such conduct cannot be agreeable to the intereſt of humane Society. It gives a fatal blow to the Eccleſiaſtical Community. For if every one may follow his private Sentiments, by whatſoever Topics they are impreſſed upon him, Eccleſiaſtical Rulers will have nothing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49823:145"/>to do. Thoſe Precepts, <hi>Obey them that are over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch over your ſouls,</hi> Heb. 13.17. <hi>Know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12. are made inſignificant.</p>
               <p>The Civil Society will likewiſe quickly feel the effects of this Doctrine. The diverſity which is a natural conſequence of it, will produce diſlike amongſt the ſeveral parties.</p>
               <p>This diſlike by the fervour of Paſſion will quickly be boyled up into an Enmity. Enmity, when any party has potency enough to give ſome reaſonable aſſurance of conqueſt, will break out into a combuſtion, and entomb the Society in its own aſhes.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is ſaid, That it is reſtraint that produceth commotion: it may be juſtly replied, That a prudent reſtraint cannot be charged with any ſuch crime. The things of Religion are either clear, and viſibly eſſential to Salvation: or elſe doubtful, and not of ſuch peremptory ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. A reſtraint in the firſt caſe, to hinder men from oppoſing the moſt important propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and as clear as the Sun-beams, is ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That it can adminiſter no juſt occaſion to the rational part of the World to be mutinous. It is but a diſcreet proviſion againſt Monſters in Morality and Divinity, who are obſtinately reſolved to diſpute the cleareſt dictates of Reaſon. Such perſons notoriouſly reflect upon the Divine Honour, do a manifeſt hurt to themſelves, invite the diſpleaſure of Heaven to fall down upon the Community. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caſe, a charitable forbearance, prudent
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49823:146"/>condeſcenſions are highly commendable. The ſpeaking the truth in love will be more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious than all external violence. If Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are neceſſitated to interpoſe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, allay the heat of debates, and prevent the miſchiefs which may emerge from them: They muſt remember the ſpirit and temper of the Goſpel, which forbids the calling down fire from Heaven, and the uſing ſanguinary methods, for the reducing of thoſe whom they conceive to be in errour. Where ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per prevails; if commotions ariſe, they muſt not be charged upon the Conſtitution, but the inordinate luſts of men, which tranſport them beyond their due meaſures, and will not permit them to perſevere in a deportment ſutable to their condition. Divine Wiſdom has digeſted the Community into Two Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: Governours and Private Perſons. To the firſt belongs the judgment of Deciſion: to both the judgment of Diſcretion, That they may know what to do, agreeable to their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the reſtraint be from that which is evil, we ought chearfully to ſubmit, and be thankful to our Rulers for the preventing our precipitation into ruin. If from that which is really good, by reaſon of an antecedent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation from God, we are to perſevere in well doing; and in the preſervation of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, ſo quietly demean our ſelves, as it may be apparent, That we are byaſſed with the moſt tender regards to the Peace of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. If this Order was obſerved, Governours might reſtrain what they conceive to be amiſs,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49823:146"/>and the world continue without Commotions. Wars ariſe from a violation of the Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the not being contented with that condition, which the Providence of Heaven thinks fit to place us in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such Conduct is not agreeable to the propenſities of Intellectual Nature. Men are generally inclined, not to truſt to the dictates of their own Reaſon in the concerns of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion without ſupernal direction. It is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to believe, That the Deity will be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and Honoured by ſome actions, which have their ſole dependence upon his Will. (By them the moſt emphatical acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Soveraignty are made) And the knowledge of ſuch Actions can be conveyed to us in no other way but by revelation. This is the cauſe why all Nations have given a ready ear to thoſe who have pretended converſe with the Deity. We have an evident inſtance in the Sibyls, who were believed to be admitted to the Counſels and privacies of the Gods, the memory of which is ſtill preſerved in their name. <gap reason="foreign">

When they were caſually burnt with the Capitol, Three Embaſſadours were diſpatched abroad, to make inquiſition for ſuch Verſes as did bear their name. The like was done by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in many parts of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:49823:147"/>World in order to the reparation of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable loſs. Thoſe Verſes, that were found, were committed to a Colledge of Prieſts, which continued to the time of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the firſt. They were of ſuch eſteem, That nothing out of them might ſee the light, without the allowance of the Senate. There was a fear upon Governours, leſt the People wholly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by their Authority, ſhould under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences drawn from thence, attempt an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Religion.</p>
               <p>An Honour, not inferiour to this, was paid to the Oracles. Tho' <hi>Cato</hi> with ſome others did diſcern, That their Reſponſes did proceed from infernal Spirits: yet the generality, who were not ſo quick-ſighted, thro' a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity, to give credit to revelation, had a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative eſteem for them. If it was ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as is pretended, to rely upon our Reaſon only for our Guide in the concerns of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it cannot be imagined, how every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be ſo diſpoſed to a renunciation of their own Sentiments, and with ſo much cheerfulneſs acquieſce in this pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>Our Reaſon in its moſt refined ſtate would be no competent Guide alone, much leſs in its preſent ſtate of imperfection. As God has made Man for Religion, ſo he has furniſhed him with a double advantage, Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Reaſon has a certain ſphere, within which its activity is to be confined. If it tranſgreſſeth its limits, it becomes as prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, as the Sea, when it rebels againſt its
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49823:147"/>bounds and makes an inundation. The Eye of the Intellect has its Horizon as well as the Eye of Senſe. Where Reaſon ends, Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begins. This is the Teleſcope, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets, and makes plain, what the eye before had but an imperfect diſcovery of: or elſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſeth that, which before was under a total concealment. Therefore God deſigning Man for Religion, has, beſides what he has diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Law of Nature, divers ways and manners revealed himſelf in all Ages.

               <p>What God was pleaſed to reveal theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways, He by his Providence communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted throughout the World. That which He diſcovered to <hi>Adam</hi> by the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Adam</hi> communicated to his Sons and Daughters, from whom all mankind proceed. The thred of their lives was ſpun out to ſuch a length, That Three of them, <hi>Methuſalem, Sem,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> were in a capacity to carry on the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, till a little before <hi>Jacob</hi>'s going down into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> What was diſcovered by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was committed to a People, who had their habitation in the center of the known World. From thence this celeſtial Light was communicated in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue to all parts of the circumference. Upon this account we read of devout Men at <hi>Jeruſalem, out of every nation under heaven, Act.</hi> 2.5. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was not the only perſon which heard of the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was revealed by the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49823:148"/>They are in a ready way to fall into the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt errours. Thoſe who have no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs to Sail by, but the light of their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, whatſoever Topic it is derived from, will quickly make ſhipwreck of Faith and a good Conſcience. There is no ſuperſtition ſo barbarous, but they may be reconciled to the belief of the reaſonableneſs of it, and think, they are obliged to a conformity unto it. It was a real trouble to the Votaries of <hi>Moloch,</hi> to abſtain from murdering their children, and offering them up to that Idol. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had no ſatisfaction in their own Spirits, if they did not make religious addreſſes to Apes and Crocodiles.</p>
               <p>He who is governed only by his own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will be apt to boggle at the peculiar Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Worſhip, the moſt bleſſed and ſacred Trinity. This Myſtery is too deep for the line of a finite underſtanding to reach to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of. He will be under ſtrong inclinations to raiſe objections againſt it, and err about that, which is neceſſary to his Salvation. And he who is tainted with this diſtemper, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perſeveres in it, the Apoſtle ſays, is ſubverted and ſelf-condemned, if not formally, yet virtually according to an equitable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, even as thoſe who thruſt from them the Word, are ſaid to judge themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of eternal life.</p>
               <p>Indeed we are told, That Speculative Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, about the Myſteries of Religion, have no hurt in them, and that we may be as ſafe on the leſt as on the right ſide. Becauſe there
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:49823:149"/>is no diſobedience in them. They are unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It is uncharitable to think them damnable. A Catalogue of thoſe which are ſo, cannot be made. The ſault cannot be known by the guilty. The probability of Truth on both ſides aſſures us, That God will not puniſh thoſe that err. Such errours cannot be diſpleaſing, which have their allowance from Conſcience, the Vice-gerent of God. To all which I will reply in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Errour is incluſive of Diſobedience. We are under an obligation to ſubmit our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to Divine Revelation as well as our Wills, and we are commanded, not only to endeavour to find out the Truth, but actually to find it. <hi>Try all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> To try, imports the ſearch; to hold faſt, ſuppoſeth the finding: the promiſe is made to thoſe which are ſucceſsful in their inquiry. This is Life Eternal to know, and not only to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it. Is it not an act of diſobedience, when God has given us the Light of his Word to walk by, to make it our free choice to neglect this infallible Guide, and prefer the Light of our own private judgment, which way ſoever communicated to us. He who refuſes the Light of the Sun in the day time for his conduct, and travels only in the night by Moon-ſhine, tho' he endeavours to the utmoſt to find his way by thoſe dim emanations: yet in caſe he loſe it, the fault is entirely to be reſolved into himſelf, who might have enjoyed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of a greater Light, which would have effectually ſecured him againſt deviation.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:49823:149"/>2. Errours in Religion are not unavoidable. God has made a plentiful proviſion for our direction. The Scripture is the Pandect of the Divine Will, ſufficient to inſtruct the Man of God, he, who errs, has nothing to charge but his own will, in whoſe power it was to have continued the ſcrutiny, till the object had been diſintangled and ſet free from all real ſcruples. When the object is arrived at ſuch a degree of clarity, there is no fear of deception, it being not reconcileable with the Divine Veracity, that our faculty ſhould be ſo compoſed, as to be deceived in that caſe. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour proceeds from our giving our aſſent too haſtily, before the propoſition be clear to us. It being in the power of the Will to ſuſpend the aſſent till that time, we can with juſtice charge nothing but the Will as the fountain of the aberration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no uncharitableneſs to ſay, That errour is damnable. Faith and Charity go hand in hand. That Propoſition which is the object of the firſt, cannot be inconſiſtent with the ſecond. Now it is evident, That it is a branch of our Creed, that ſome errours are of this nature. <hi>Whoſoever abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God,</hi> Jo. 2. ep. v. 7. <hi>There ſhall be falſe Teachers among you, who ſhall privily bring in damnable Hereſies,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. <hi>If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know, that he which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth a ſinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.19, 20. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from errour procures Salvation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49823:150"/>in errour muſt inevitably infer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Hereſies are reckoned amongſt thoſe things, which ſhut men out of the kingdom of Heaven. All ſins whatſoever ſpring from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the underſtanding. This is expreſſed in the names which the Scripture gives to ſin. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.27. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4. The reaſon why a juſt Catalogue of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours damnable to all men cannot be made, is, becauſe that errour may be damnable to one which is not ſo to another. Obligations to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſpring out of thoſe advantages, which Men have to know the mind of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all not enjoying the ſame advantages, cannot lie under an equal obligation. Tho' this makes it difficult to give the number of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: yet it is no impediment to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their quality. Number and quality are different modes, and fall under diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. That kind of Locuſts which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the fruits of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from others of the ſame denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and yet it was impoſſible to make a Catalogue of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fault may be known by the guilty, if they pleaſe to look back, after they have made that, which they call a mature ſearch,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49823:150"/>and obſerve, how often they have given their aſſent, before there has been ſuch a degree of clarity in the object, as could with juſtice lay a claim to it. Extrinſecal reſpects, and not the merit of the Cauſe, do uſually prevail with Men to take up an Opinion: and when they have eſpouſed it, the often repetition of that, which at firſt they knew to be an uncertainty, makes them at laſt to give credit to it in good earneſt. Tho' they were Lyars at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet in the end became believers. The beſt way, to diſcover the deception, is to make a review, and to conſider the firſt motives which did introduce their credence. They are uſually ſome excentrical regards to the perſons of ſome, which are under the ſame perſwaſion. The fallibility of ſuch inducements will give us juſt reaſon to look back, withdraw our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and not to terminate it upon any thing for the future, but that which doth manifeſt its truth by undeniable evidence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God hath not put us into a ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. Truths of peremptory neceſſity are delivered to us in demonſtrations. If they be hid, it is only to thoſe whoſe eyes are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the God of this World. The light of the glorious Goſpel is plain and conſpicuous enough in it ſelf. If every thing muſt be eſteemed probable only, againſt which ſome luxuriant wits may deviſe objections, the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt propoſitions will not arrive at the honour of being accounted certain, but muſt be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take their place amongſt probabilities It is as eaſie for a ſceptical fancy to raiſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49823:151"/>ſcruples, as for Travellers in dry weather to raiſe duſt in the high way. It is reported of Car.<note place="margin">Vedel. p. <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Perronius,</hi> when he had made an Oration before <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> to prove the exiſtence of the Deity, with the great applauſe of the Auditory, he made a tender to ſpeak as much on the contrary ſide. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more viſible to us than local motion, and yet the certainty of it has not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from being encountred with oppoſition. Objections are like clouds, not all of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Sun, and render his light dubious: but thoſe only which lye in a direct line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that Luminary and the viſive faculty. Many objections may be ſtarted on either ſide. but if the ſplendour of the object be ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as not to permit them to come in a direct line betwixt it, and the perceptive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, they ought not to make any abatement, and degrade the object from a ſtate of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to a ſtate of probability.</p>
               <p n="7">7. An erroneous Conſcience is no more the true Vicegerent of God, than the <hi>Pſeudo-Smerdis</hi> was the Brother of <hi>Cambyſes:</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin Warbeck</hi> the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth. An erroneous Conſcience is but a Counterfeit, and no more to be obeyed than thoſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If nothing falls under condemnation, which is done according to Conſcience, S. <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion was as unblameable, as he believed himſelf to be, when he expreſſed the higheſt degree of enmity to the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> alſo by the ſame way of arguing will be diſcharged from all guilt, who thought
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:49823:151"/>it an acceptable ſervice to God to ſhed the blood of his Servants, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.3. Errour in the Conſcience is to be reſolved into the Will as the ſpring of it: and therefore cannot ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſie thoſe bad effects, which it doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produce. Conſcience is nothing but the Judgment: for the right information of which a ſufficient proviſion is made. We then err, when we neglect to make uſe of this proviſion, and acquieſce in ſudden dictates, grounded upon ſomething which is extrinſecal to the Cauſe, and do not perſevere in our ſcrutiny, till matters be brought to ſuch a degree of perſpicuity, as duely qualifies them for aſſent.</p>
               <p>I have now finiſhed the firſt particular. Our Light to direct us in the Worſhip of God, is to be directed from the Holy Scripture. I will proceed to the next.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our ſtrength to perform, what we are directed unto, we muſt expect from the Holy Spirit. His aſſiſtance is either General or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial. General. Where the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is accompanied with a Divine Power, whereby the hearers are put into a capacity of complying with the demands of it. Upon this account it is ſtiled the Adminiſtration of the Spirit, the Law of the Spirit of Life, the Power of God unto Salvation. And Chriſt is repreſented as waiting to ſee what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be made of it. Behold I ſtand at the door and knock. And thoſe who fruſtrate the Divine Call, are ſaid to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt. And thoſe who are obedient, to be begotten again by the Word, which is a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49823:152"/>work appropriated to the Spirit, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent. Such perſons have a power to know, That there is a Supreme Being, which governs the World: to diſcern their own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in breaking thoſe Laws, by which he governs; to be filled with conſternation, upon the account of the eternal pains, which the Goſpel threatens to the diſobedient; to have ſome hope of Amneſty and forgiveneſs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Evangelical Promiſes: and under theſe diſpoſitions to caſt themſelves down before the throne of the divine benignity, and with all humility implore the communication of a higher aſſiſtance, That they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſerve God with a Spirit of love and delight, and with an Eye entirely fixed upon his Glory. Thoſe who have made, by the help of this general grace, ſo near an approach to the Kingdom of Heaven, and have ſo far <hi>wrought out their Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi> It is the uſual method of the Divine Spirit to communicate unto them a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial aid, <hi>to work in them to will and to do.</hi> Whereas the proud, who refuſe to improve this talent are rejected: theſe humble perſons find acceptance, and have a greater meaſure of grace communicated to them. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 57.15. They are in the ready way to be impregnated with a principle which is ſtiled, <hi>a new heart,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>the new man.</hi> Eph. 4.24. <hi>the hidden man of the heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>the unction,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.27. And likewiſe to be excited by a ſupernal influence,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49823:152"/>to act according to this principle. Tho' the habitual gift is perfect as it deſcends from the Father of Lights: yet as it ſtands in relation to the Recipient, out of which it does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel all the remains of the Primitive Apoſtaſy, it being but imperfect, it has need of freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences to quicken it. Upon this account God is pleaſed, not only to enkindle the ſparks of grace, but to prevent their decay by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening them with the breath of his Holy Spirit. He not only enſtamps a new bias upon the Heart;<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> but with his own hand puts it forward toward the mark. This influence is that, which <hi>David</hi> ſo importunately petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for, <hi>ſhew me thy ways, teach me thy paths, lead me in thy truth,</hi> Pſ. 25.4, 5. <hi>Open mine eyes,</hi> Pſ. 119.18. <hi>make me to underſtand the way of thy precepts,</hi> v. 27. <hi>Teach me the way of thy ſtatutes,</hi> v. 33. <hi>Incline my heart unto thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> v. 26. <hi>Make me to go in the way of thy commandments,</hi> v. 35. <hi>order my ſteps in thy word,</hi> v. 133. This holy Man in theſe applications muſt aim at the obtaining of ſome thing, which he was ſenſible of the want of. At the time of this addreſs, he was inveſted with a Religious Principle; and therefore muſt have his Eye upon a Divine Influence, whereby his heart might be excited, and drawn forth to action. To this is conſonant what is expreſſed in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ways.</hi> The ſtony heart is not only removed, and a tractable temper placed in the room, which is ſtiled <hi>a heart of fleſh:</hi> but the Spirit is to be put into
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:49823:153"/>them, in order to the ſtirring them up to walk in the ways of God. The ſame thing is aſſerted in the Ep. to the <hi>Hebrews, c.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>The God of peace make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That which is moſt pleaſing is the Act of Religion; it having a nearer affinity to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is a pure act, than the Power has. The working of this by a Celeſtial influence is petitioned for. Faith, which is the ſpring of Religious Worſhip is repreſented in the very act to be the gift of God, <hi>Bhil.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>To you it is given not only to believe, but to ſuffer,</hi> as, <gap reason="foreign">

Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to all this are the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you, to will and to do.</hi> It is not only the power to will and to do, which is repreſented as the product of Divine Grace, but the volition and action. The influence is ſo efficacious, That the acts, which are freely exerted by Men, are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him from whom it proceeds, as <gap reason="foreign">

Thoſe, who are thus dealt with, are ſaid to be drawn by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.44. After they have gone thro' the preparatory work by the help of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grace: This ſpecial effectually pulls their
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:49823:153"/>hearts, and brings them over to Chriſt. This is the uſual method of God's proceeding with thoſe who live under the Goſpel. He puts a Talent into the hand of every one: and if it be rightly uſed, he ſecures to the improver by promiſe the communication of a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſiſtance: So that if any want it, none are blameable for the defect, but themſelves. He, who is unfaithful in the diſcharge of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior truſt, cannot expect to be imployed in a greater. He who hath a ſtock of a hundred pounds, and imbezleth it, may thank his own folly, That a greater ſum is not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. It is no prejudice to what has been aſſerted, That God deals ſometimes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Men. S. <hi>Paul</hi> before his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was ſo far from being under any prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory diſpoſition, That he was employing his ſtrength to deſtroy the Faith of Chriſt, at that time, when he was effectually called by him. There is no rule, but may admit of ſome exception. God has his choſen veſſels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Captain General of our Salvation has, beſides his other Regiments,<note place="margin">Artic. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> one peculiar to himſelf. God hath choſen in Chriſt ſome out of Mankind. Helps are vouchſafed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which exceed the ordinary meaſures.

               <p>As for thoſe, who have not the Goſpel preached unto them, the divine procedure with them is more concealed. As the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth induſtriouſly give an account of the Holy Seed, and but occaſionally touch upon thoſe generations, which are out of that line: So it gives a moſt diſtinct repreſentation of the method of his operation with thoſe to whom the Sacred Oracles are communicated, but not ſo full a diſcloſure of it with others, which are not admitted to a participation of that immunity. That, which is revealed is ſufficient to demonſtrate, That God is not wanting to them; and if they miſcarry, their deſtruction is chargeable only upon themſelves. It is manifeſt, That they with all others are naturally ſo much under the power of that corruption, which is contracted by the Fall: That the Image of God is obliterated in them, and they rendered unable to do any thing, which is ſpiritually good. The Second <hi>Adam</hi> has ſo far made a reparation, That the light of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49823:154"/>Reaſon, in ſome meaſure, diſcovering their obligations to their Creator is impreſſed upon them. He who is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, lighteth every Man that comes into the World. That which may be known of God is manifeſt in them: not ſo much upon the account of the remains of the Divine Image, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſtate of innocency, as a ſecondary diſcovery, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for God hath manifeſted it unto them. There is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in every man encloſed with darkneſs, and the effects of the Primitive Apoſtaſie: <hi>but the inſpiration of the Lord giveth underſtanding.</hi> When men had benighted themſelves, it was the pleaſure of the Lord to light a candle for them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.27. This light is not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but a power to comport with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. For it is plain, they receive ſo much from God, that for their defect in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of them, they are rendered inexcuſable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. If light had been imparted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their obligations, and a power denied to ſatisfie them; no fairer excuſe could have been deviſed than this, That the Divine Benignity, ſince their Primitive Apoſtaſie, whereby they loſt their Light and Power; has been pleaſed to give them ſome Light again, to ſee their duty, but withhold a Power to diſcharge it.</p>
               <p>To all this we may add, That the fault is in themſelves, that they enjoy no fuller a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, and thoſe aſſiſtances which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it. By not improvement of that, which they have, they are deprived of a juſt claim to that which is greater. The Sound of the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49823:155"/>Goſpel, which went to the uttermoſt parts of the Earth, was drowned with the clamour of their exorbitances. Divine Providence not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe provocations, has placed the Candleſtick at no ſuch diſtance from them, as renders them uncapable of receiving benefit by it. They traffick with thoſe in temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns which are acquainted with it: And if their affection to him, who is the deſire of all Nations, was not thro' a voluntary defect grown very languid, they may do the ſame in Spirituals.</p>
               <p>Tho' we are not able to delineate the manner of God's giving his aid to all in the concerns of Religion: Yet we have no inferiour degree of aſſurance in the general, That all do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch an aſſiſtance, as renders them inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, if they do not perform, what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. To aſſert, That he withholds ſuch help, makes a very diſhonourable reflection upon him. It caſts a cloud upon the glorious conſtellation of his Attributes: in particular, upon his Goodneſs, as tho' he was leſs kind under the Second Covenant, than under the Firſt: His Juſtice, as tho' he did condemn men for that, which it was never in their power to prevent: His Mercy, in offering external means to thoſe, who have no power to make uſe of them. It has a tendency to deface that idea which we naturally have of God in our Souls, and beget in the room of it very enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conceptions: As tho' he did require the Lame to walk, and yet not furniſh them with ſuch ſupports as are of peremptory neceſſity to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49823:155"/>that motion. It leaves no matter for the Worm of Conſcience to breed out of. If the damned knew, That a ſufficient power, while they were upon the Theatre of this World, was not given to them to eſcape the Torment they are in, how can they reflect with indignation upon their own folly, for the miſ-ſpending their time, and the loſs of their opportunity, to gain a more eaſie ſtate? No man is inclined to make penſive reflections upon himſelf, for the not bringing to paſs impoſſibilities. It ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders exhortation uſeleſs. Counſel ſuppoſeth a power in him, to whom it is directed, to comply with it. None will exhort a perſon, to ſee, who has irrecoverably loſt his viſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, or one, who is dead, to move. It ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the nature of repentance. Who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf concerned to grieve for the omiſſion of that, which was never in his power to do; or for the doing of that, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had power to omit?</p>
               <p>As God created Angels with a Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to that which is Good; brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with a Faculty determined to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects: So he has made Man in a middle ſtate, not ſecured, as the ſupernal Spirits are, nor determined as inferiour Animals. He has endued him with a ſufficient power, which he may uſe, or abuſe, improve or neglect. This is evident in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who undoubtedly had a power to perſevere in his innocency; and in thoſe, who are converted by the grace of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> whom all confeſs to have a power to do more good than they do. He
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49823:156"/>who worketh after the counſel of his will, is pleaſed, <hi>to make man after his image, and leave him in the hands of his own counſel, Ecclus.</hi> 15, 14. His concourſe with him he adapts to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. As the ſinite Spirit, which animates the body, has its ſeveral Organs by which its operations are modified: So likewiſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Spirit, who by his omnipotent interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſuſtains the Univerſe. All the Creatures are his Organs, ſome free, ſome neceſſary. Every one he uſeth according to its Nature. Thoſe, which are neceſſary, he concurrs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily with. Thoſe which are free, he ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily accommodates himſelf to their freedom, and by this means keeps up the order which he has eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>This aſſertion is not prejudicial to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. It is manifeſt, that he knows, what Evil Men will do; although they determine themſelves to the doing of it. By a parity of reaſon he muſt know the Good, altho' they uſe their own freedom in the doing of it.</p>
               <p>Neither is it injurious to his Sovereignty. He has the hearts of all Men in his own hand. He can interpoſe his determining influence. He can take away the power whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables them to determine themſelves. All their determinations he can ſo order, as to make them ſubſervient to the deſign of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it deſtroy the immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the Will upon him. It is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in its Being for conſervation: in its acts for his prevenient grace, and ſimultaneous
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:49823:156"/>concourſe. Tho' God is the cauſe of every Being, yet not of all the modes of a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as is evident in the evil of ſin, which is ſuch a mode, and yet brought to paſs without his efficiency.</p>
               <p>If any difficulty ariſe about the manner of God's operating with the Will, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend, we muſt not let go the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of that, which is clear, for that which is obſcure. Things many times are very perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, when the modes are concealed. He would be accounted very vain, who ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deny, That there is any ſuch thing as light, becauſe it is difficult to explain the way of its emanation from the great Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the World. Every Man is ſenſible of a determining Power within himſelf: That in the midſt of his intellectual diſcuſſions, he has a liberty to make his election of ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as he apprehends to be moſt agreeable to himſelf. To deny this, becauſe we are not fully ſatisfied about every mode in the doing of it, is the ſame thing, as if we ſhould affirm, That there is no ſuch Sence as Seeing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not yet agreed, whether the Eye perform its office by the entertainment of ſome <hi>Effluviums</hi> from the Object, or by the help of ſome preſſure only upon the Optic Nerve.</p>
               <p>Now I have done with the ſecond particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, namely, the ſtrength, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to perform what we are directed to. This we muſt expect from the Spirit of God. And now I proceed to the laſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:49823:157"/>3. The acceptance of what we perform, is procured by the ſatisfaction and merit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. In order to the clearing up of this Truth, the following ſteps muſt be taken.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The acceptance of our Worſhip and Service is not upon its own account. There are great defects in the beſt of our performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Our Faith, tho' it be unfeigned, yet it wants That firmneſs; our Love, tho' ſincere, That fervour which the Law requires. The Law is natural and immutable, and can no more abate in its demands, than the fire can ceaſe to be of a hot nature, or the Sun to be a lucid Body. If our moſt plauſible actions were examined according to the rigour of it, many flames would be diſcovered in them. The Prophet tells us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 64.6.</note> 
                  <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as ſilthy rags,</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> tho' it be variouſly interpreted, yet all the Gloſſes agree in charging our moſt valuable ſervices with imperfection. The precedent words juſtifie the Expoſition. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing.</hi> The fountain being impure, the ſtreams which iſſue from it, will carry with them ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures of the ſame impurity. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We know but in part;</hi> it is as ſure, That we love and obey but in part. The Will being principally concerned in the Fall, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily lie under a depravation equal to that of the Underſtanding. It is a ſaying among the Rabbins:<note place="margin">Buxt. Rab. Lex. rad <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>So long as the juſt live, they are at war with concupiſcence.</hi> They affirm, there are Three Sins, which daily every man is guilty of, <hi>Sinful Thoughts, want of attention in Prayer,

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Acceptance is not upon the account of the favour of God, without the interpoſal of ſatisfaction for ſin: by ſatisfaction we muſt underſtand the doing of ſomething which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the damage, which is received by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and the quieting thereby the mind of the injured, who is provoked by reaſon of the damage.</p>
               <p>A great injury is done by Sin to the Supreme Rector of the World. His Authority is tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon, and the Majeſty of his Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, his Government expoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, publick Order unhinged, and by this means he is juſtly incenſed. The ready way to repair the damage, and atone his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is to require, That the penalties due to the tranſgreſſion, or ſuch as are equivalent to them, be ſuffered; and in them to expreſs his juſt indignation againſt Sin, and impreſs upon all ſuch a fear and reverence, as the Laws of Heaven do challenge.</p>
               <p>That this ſhould be done antecedently to Pardon and Acceptance, is evidently the Will of God, declared in the Holy Scripture. There we find, That there is no acceptance without remiſſion, and there is no remiſſion without the ſhedding of blood, and that this blood is the blood of a Mediator, thro' which we muſt have redemption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. This
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49823:158"/>is the reaſon why the Divine Amneſty, from the time of the Primitive Apoſtaſie, has had a conſtant aſpect upon this blood. When the Apoſtle aſſerts concerning the Mediator, if he had been to offer up himſelf often, as the High-Prieſt entred into the Holy of Holieſt every year with the blood of others, then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the World. He plainly intimates, That from the beginning the Father has had a regard to the blood and ſufferings of his Son in the remiſſion of Sins. Tho' ſatisfaction was not then made, yet it was promiſed. Captives are frequently ſet free, in conſideration of the ranſom promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, before it be actually paid.</p>
               <p>As ſatisfaction is certainly agreeable to the Will of God: So it ſeems to be ſutable to the propenſity of his nature. Suppoſing the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is neceſſary that he have a Soveraignty and Dominion over it: and if he be a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord over the Creation, he muſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally govern it. It is a defect to be inveſted with Power, and not to exerciſe it in relation to the Community: and if he governs, it muſt be by Law. Government ſuppoſeth Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Obedience in the Intellectual part of Creation, muſt be an act of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Underſtanding cannot act, except it has a knowledge of the Will of him who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns. His Will publiſhed and made known is a Law. If there be a Law, it muſt be holy, it being enacted by him, who is infinite in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſanctity: and if it be holy, he cannot but love it, the ſame neceſſity which doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49823:158"/>him to love himſelf, will engage him to love the reſemblance. And if he love his Law, he cannot but hate ſin which is oppoſite to it. Hatred to that which is contrary to Holineſs, muſt be as natural to him, as to love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Holineſs. And if it be natural to terminate his hatred upon ſin, by an equal neceſſity he is obliged to puniſh it. For hatred is never found in any without a peremptory deſire to do evil to that which is its object: and ſuch a deſire, when it is in one, who wills nothing raſhly, who is armed with ſufficiency of power to execute, whatſoever he wills, who cannot be diverted from execution by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen emergency, muſt neceſſarily take effect, and whatſoever evil is done to ſin by him who cannot err in his adminiſtrations, muſt have the formality of puniſhment, all evil being either the evil of ſin or the evil of puniſhment. This penalty muſt either be inflicted upon the Offender, and then there will be no place left for Pardon and acceptance; or elſe upon ſome perſon, who is willing to become a ſurety for the Delinquent, and is able by his ſufferings to reſtore that honour, which publick order has been impaired in, and by this means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the mind of the Supreme Rector, and this is properly ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>What is uſually ſaid, That if the nature of God doth oblige him to puniſh ſin, then he is by the ſame neceſſity ingaged to puniſh it in the offender, is of no moment. His hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not primarily terminated upon the perſon, but the ſin; if the guilt be transferred by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49823:159"/>to a Surety, it is not incongruous to aſſert, That the ſin may be puniſhed in him. Some acts which are in general natural to God, are free and undetermined in reſpect of the modification. To Govern the World (ſuppoſing the Creation) is eſſential to him: yet the mode, whether he will do it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by himſelf only, or make uſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Men is his free choice. So tho' to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Sin is natural, yet the manner of doing of it, whether in the perſon offending or his undertaker, is at his election.</p>
               <p>If it be further added, That if it be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to puniſh, it muſt be done, ſo ſoon as the tranſgreſſion is committed, and in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. That which is natural, admits of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. The reply is eaſie, This is true of that which is natural in Creatures which want freedom and life: but it is otherwiſe in the Creator, who is an Intellectual Being. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Creation, it is natural to him to do good: and yet it is free for him to time his bounty as he pleaſeth, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it in what degrees and methods he judgeth moſt convenient. It is natural for him to give a Law to his Creature: but he is not determined to the circumſtances of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, whether by innate Ideas only, or by revelation. The neceſſity, he is under, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, which admits of the interpoſal of Counſel about the modes, and circumſtances of his actions. If it be replied, That what is natural in God, tho' it may be free in theſe reſpects, yet it muſt be always expreſſed in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:49823:159"/>ſome meaſure or other, which cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of his puniſhing ſin. I anſwer, That Sin in ſome meaſure is always puniſhed,<note place="margin">Janſ. Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. <hi>2.</hi> l. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> ſo ſoon as it is committed: from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Tranſgreſſour is deprived of that contentment, which doth naturally emerge from a ſence of a compliance with the Law of Creation. The Worm of Conſcience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently grows out of the feculency and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Soul is defiled with. The ſerenity of mind, wherein our preſent beatitude conſiſts, is inſtantly loſt; and the anticipations of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture torments ſucceed. The ſparks of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire are quickly kindled. A ſence of the juſt judgment of God, That he, who doth ſuch things, is worthy of death, fills the Soul with horrour and the deepeſt conſternation. Thoſe bleſſings, which before, the Delinquent was encircled with, are Metamorphiſed into curſes, Plough-ſhares converted into Swords. Pruning-hooks into Spears, every thing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a direful ſhape and menacing aſpect.</p>
               <p>If it be added, That puniſhment is a debt, and every one has power freely to remit his debts. I anſwer this is not true of all kinds of debt. There is a debt of Active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which we owe to God, from which he cannot give us a full diſcharge. The Law of Nature is as unchangeable, as his Eſſence. Thoſe who are guilty of open defamation are indebted to the defamed, and obliged by pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive agnitions to re-inveſt them with that honour, they have robbed them of. This debt the perſons injured, have no more right to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49823:160"/>remit, than they have to murder themſelves: their credit being as valuable as their lives. Sin deprives God of his glory, which he can by no means part with, and therefore in juſtice muſt require reſtitution by ſome convenient ſatisfaction, before he remit the penalty due to the Tranſgreſſour, and receive him into favour.</p>
               <p n="3">This ſatisfaction, which is ſo neceſſary, before we can have an intereſt in the divine acceptance, Jeſus Chriſt has made. He has repaied the damae which publick order and the Laws of Heaven received from our Sins: and fully contented the mind of the Supreme Rector, who in juſtice was obliged to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the honour of his appointments. This will be manifeſt if we conſider the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Jeſus Chriſt has ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>red the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſin. What he ſuffered, was in our ſtead. The damage done by ſin is repaired, and the mind of the Supreme Rector fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and reconciled unto us, upon the terms of the New Covenant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt Jeſus has ſuffered the puniſhment of our Sin.</p>

               <p>For all this, there muſt be ſome important reaſon. It cannot be imagined, That he who was intereſted in the higheſt degree of the Love of his Father; That never had done any thing to merit the leaſt unkindneſs, ſhould be treated with ſo much ſeverity upon ſome unneceſſary grounds.</p>
               <p>The could be no motives of an inferiour Nature, which did induce the eternal Father, to ſuffer his only Son the Lord of Life to die. The Lord of Glory to be obſcured with the clouds of ignominy and reproach. There muſt be ſomething in the caſe, which could not be accompliſhed in any other method. All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that, What the <hi>Socinians</hi> alledge as the reaſon, might have been brought to paſs upon
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49823:161"/>far eaſier terms. They tell us, That Chriſt ſuffered to confirm the Covenant, induce us to perform the conditions of it, to make way for his ingreſs into Heaven in order to the performing the Office of a Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The Firſt of theſe might have been done by the working of Miracles, which are the broad Seal of Heaven. What can any reaſonable Man deſire more, than a clear revelation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the terms upon which God will be reconciled, and an aſſurance given by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operations, That there's no colluſion in the Declaration.</p>
               <p>The Exemplary Life of our Bleſſed Lord, is ſufficient to invite us to be agreeable in our Converſation to the conditions of the New Covenant. His Death, with all the terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances attending it, have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to affright Men from embracing his Doctrin. No Man is naturally inclined to eſpouſe that way, which may expoſe him to ſo much ſorrow. Was there no more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Death of Chriſt, than what <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> aſſerts, He might after his Immaculate Life ſpent in this World, like <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> have been immediately tranſlated into Heaven, and there with as much advantage, as if he had ſuffered the pains of death, have tranſacted all thoſe things appertaining to our reconciliation, which they attribute unto him. He was above Thirty Years in this ſublunary ſtate, conteſting with the anxieties of humane Life, and therefore muſt neceſſarily be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fence of our infirmities. His whole
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:49823:161"/>Life was meritorious, and therefore, there is no reaſon to think, That the moſt eaſie way to Heaven would have been denied him, had his ſufferings imported no more than what our Adverſaries in this Cauſe affirm. The God of Nature and Grace doth not uſe to do any thing in vain.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The reaſons of the ſufferings of our Bleſſed Lord, which muſt be granted to be of more importance than any thing which has been alledged by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Holy Scripture reſolves into our ſin, and repreſents his Paſſion as the Puniſhment of it.</p>
               <p>Man violating the Law of his Creation, if nothing did interpoſe to prevent the infliction of Puniſhment, our condition would be a ſtate of deſperation, deſtructive of that which is moſt eſſential to Religion, and pleaſing unto God. No place would be left for the emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his benignity, which he is eminently delighted with. He being propenſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and his hatred to Sin, and love to his Law, inclining him not to do it, without ſome ſevere expreſſion of his deteſtation firſt made againſt the violation of his Command: in order to the reconciling of theſe propenſities, and making way for his clemency to exert it ſelf, his eternal Son has freely offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bear the penalty due to us upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Sin. For this reaſon, he is ſaid <hi>to be made a curſe, Gal.</hi> 3.13. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Crellius</hi> tell us, That the word here cannot be taken in this fence, becauſe he, who is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly accurſed, is the object of Divine Hatred, which cannot be aſſerted of the Son of God: and the curſe which he ſuffered, was the death of the Croſs; but the curſe of the Law is Eternal death.</p>
               <p>To which I reply, He which is accurſed upon his own account, is the object of Divine Hatred: but he, That is ſo upon the account of another, freely bearing the curſe in order to the ſatisfying Divine Juſtice, and the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the authority of the Law is not. The hatred is terminated upon the Sin which is ours, and not upon the Perſon who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to bear the demerit of it, and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accompliſh the ends which are highly agreeable to the deſires of the Supreme Rector.</p>
               <p>The Death of our Bleſſed Lord upon the Croſs, tho' it was not the ſame with Eternal Death; yet it was equivalent. The want of eternity was compenſated by the dignity of the Perſon, who was ſo contumeliouſly treated. The degrees of ſuffering, are uſually eſtimated by the quality of the perſon who ſuffereth. A Magiſtrate ſuffers more by a contumelious uſage, than a private Man: The Supreme more than he who is ſubordinate. Therefore if he who ſuffers be infinite in dignity, as the Son of God is, his puniſhment muſt have an infinity in it. And an infinite puniſhment is equipollent to that, which is eternal.</p>
               <p>Parallel to this, are the words of S. <hi>Peter, Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49823:162"/>the tree,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.24. Chriſt is ſaid to bear our ſins, that is, The puniſhment of them, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>tulit ſurſum eundo.</hi> When he was upon the Croſs, he had the burden of them, upon his ſhoulders. <hi>Crellius,</hi> in order to the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the force of this Text, ſays, That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth not neceſſarily denote to bear, it may as well be tranſlated to take away: but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it doth, yet it does not follow, That the pain he bore was a puniſhment: one may be ſaid to bear the ſins of another, who falls into any calamity occaſioned by them, altho' there be nothing of the formality of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in it. To which I anſwer, That to <hi>bear,</hi> is the proper ſignification of the word, and we are not to depart from the proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, except the circumſtances of the place put a neceſſity upon us. The Context is ſo far from obliging us to any ſuch thing; That, in caſe it may be allowed to arbitrate, it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine us to the ſignification of bearing. The ſcope of the Apoſtle is to exhort thoſe, to whom he writes, to bear with patience the ſufferings, which the profeſſion of the Goſpel might expoſe them to. In order to this end, he draws an argument from the pattern of our Bleſſed Lord, who did patiently bear the penalty of our ſins in his Body on the Tree, without any menacing returns to the Authors of his Crucifixion. The word in conjunction with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is but once more found in the New Teſtament; and, there it has evidently the fence we contend for. So Chriſt was once offered <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to bear the ſins
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:49823:163"/>of many, <hi>and to them which look for him, he ſhall appear the ſecond time without ſin, Heb.</hi> 9.28. Here are two appearances of Chriſt ſet oppoſite one to the other, the laſt without ſin, that is, without bearing the burthen of it, and therefore the firſt was with ſin. He was burdened with it, and did bear the demerit. This fence is favoured by the Context, <hi>He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to put away ſin, by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, v.</hi> 26. A Sacrifice did bear the puniſhment due to him for whom it was offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crellius</hi> overthrows himſelf, in ſaying, That <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, here ſignifies, to <hi>take away:</hi> for this <hi>taking away,</hi> muſt be performed upon the Tree. But Chriſt according to his notion did not take away Sin upon the Croſs. His ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was but preparatory to his ingreſs into Heaven, where he was firſt inveſted with a power to forgive ſin. S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a word too ſtiff to be bent into a compliance with the <hi>Socinian</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It conſtantly ſignifies to bear or carry, and for this reaſon is interpreted by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.17. <hi>He bore their ſickneſſes,</hi> that is, He did undergo much trouble and pains in the curing of them. He had no reſpite all the day: and when the even was come, (at which time others compoſe themſelves for reſt) he was preſſed upon by the multitude, and did attend this great work.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Crellius</hi> ſays in the ſecond place, (if <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies to <hi>bear,</hi> it doth not follow,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49823:163"/>That he did bear the puniſhment of ſin. He might accidentally undergo ſorrow, which was occaſioned by our ſins, in which there was nothing of the nature of puniſhment in relation to him) is of no validity.</p>
               <p>If it be granted, That it ſignifies to <hi>bear,</hi> the thing born muſt be the puniſhment of ſin. Puniſhment imports a natural evil inflicted by one in authority, That the party offended, by the commiſſion of ſome moral evil, may receive ſatisfaction, and the ends of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be ſecured. All this agrees to the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt. They import a natural evil. They were diſpleaſing to humane Nature. They were inflicted by the Supreme Rector of the World. It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him. The deſign of his Paſſion, was to make Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the injured. Our Sins robbed God of his Glory. This was reſtored by the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Son. He was ſet forth to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation to declare his Righteouſneſs. The ends of Government are eminently ſecured. His Sufferings muſt neceſſarily ſtrike a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation into all. If ſuch things were done in the green Tree, what may be expected in the drie? If he, who had no ſin of his own, was ſo ſeverely treated, what can we look for, if we perſevere in our provocations?</p>
               <p>If all things appertaining to the nature of a penalty, agree to the Sufferings of Chriſt, there is no reaſon but to believe, when Chriſt is ſaid to bear our ſins, that the meaning is, That he did bear the puniſhment of them.</p>
               <p>It is true, A Man may be ſaid to bear the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49823:164"/>miſcarriages of another, who accidentally falls under any diſaſter occaſioned by them. But the caſe here is quite otherwiſe. Nothing was fortuitous. The Perſon ſuffering was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the hands of his Crucifiers according to the determinate Counſel of Heaven. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his Paſſion, was to accompliſh all thoſe ends, which are intended in puniſhment. And that which makes an affliction to be a penalty in a proper ſenſe, is nothing but the end, which is aimed at.</p>
               <p>Conſonant to this, is what S. <hi>Paul</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>For he hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was made ſin for us, that is, Put under an obligation to ſuffer the puniſhment which our ſins had deſerved. God laid upon him the Iniquity of us all. The Tranſgreſſions of thoſe who lived in the moſt oppoſite parts of the Terreſtrial Globe, did all meet together upon him. He is the center, upon which the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of them did ſettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crellius</hi> tells us, That when Chriſt is ſaid to be made Sin, the meaning is, That he was by wicked Men, reputed and treated as a ſinner. But if this was the meaning, then Chriſt was made ſin by his Crucifiers; whereas the action is aſcribed unto God. When he is ſaid to be made ſin, ſomething muſt be underſtood, which is peculiar to him. But if <hi>Crellius</hi>'s ſence of the words prevails, the Martyrs may be ſaid to be made ſin when they were puniſhed under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Malefactors by their inveterate enemies.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49823:164"/>The <hi>Antitheſis</hi> betwixt <hi>being made ſin,</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſin,</hi> is a clear juſtification of our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. Chriſt knew no ſin, that is, was guilty of none, by any deviation of his own. Therefore when it is ſaid, He was made ſin, the meaning is, He was made guilty of ours by imputation, and by his own conſent, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with aſſent of his Father, brought under an obligation to ſuffer the penalty of it. It is manifeſt from the Text, That he was ſo made ſin for us; as we are made righteouſneſs, or righteous in him. Now it is manifeſt, That upon our performing the conditions of the New Covenant, we are made righteous in conſideration of his meritorious ſatisfaction: and therefore he was made ſin for us, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our demerit, which he undertook to make expiation for. That which induceth the <hi>Socinians</hi> to endeavour the eluſion of the evidence of the Texts which are produced, is a perſwaſion, That the fence, we contend for, is repugnant to reaſon. There can be no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but where there is guilt: there can be no guilt, where there is innocency; and there was nothing but innocency in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lamb of God. But it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, That the proper notion of guilt is nothing but an obligation to puniſhment. And it is not diſagreeable to reaſon, That ſuch an obligation ſhould be contracted by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Perſon, in caſe he be willing to ſtand in the place of the Nocent, and ſuffer the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty due to him. If he be one, who has power to diſpoſe of his own life, as our Bleſſed
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49823:165"/>Lord had; he may by an act of his Will, as well engage himſelf to lay down his life, as to lay down a ſum of Mony. Every Man may do with that, which is in his power, what he pleaſeth. Tho' it be eſſential to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted for ſin: yet it is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to be inflicted upon the ſinner. The merit of Virtue, is as perſonal and incommunicable, as the merit of ſin: yet it as not eſſential to the reward, to be always conferred upon the perſon meriting. <hi>Chimham</hi> was rewarded by <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Barzillais</hi>'s kindneſs. Children fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fare the better for their Parents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings. There is no reaſon to believe, That it is unjuſt in all caſes to puniſh one for the crime of another. God, who is not obnoxious to errour in his adminiſtrations, has done it. When he tells the people, That they ſhould have occaſion no more to uſe this Proverb, <hi>The fathers have eaten ſowr grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge:</hi> he intimates, That they had formerly occaſion ſo to do: and what was now ſaid in this matter, was but a particular favour granted to them at this time: and not to be a ſtanding rule in all ſucceeding generations. It is moſt evident, That <hi>Judah</hi> ſuffered in the reign of <hi>Joſiah</hi> for the provocations of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 23.26. Tho' they had ſins of their own to irritate Divine Juſtice: yet they were not the cauſe of their ſuffering. He, who puniſheth a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon in that reſpect in which he is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, doth the ſame thing, as if he puniſhed one, who is perfectly Innocent.</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:49823:165"/>
               <p>It is evident by the Second Command, <hi>That the iniquity of the fathers is viſited upon their children.</hi> If ſuch Children are only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, who imitate their Parents tranſgreſſion, no reaſon can be given of the limitation <hi>to the third and fourth generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That one may be puniſhed for another was not accounted unjuſt amongſt thoſe, who were governed by the light of Nature; as is evident by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or ſureties in capital matters, which did engage life for life. There can be no pretence of injury, where the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuffering freely conſents, and has a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over his own life, he having power to diſpoſe of himſelf, in his ſubmiſſion to the greateſt paſſion, he does no injury to any other; and he conſenting upon the cleareſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, no injury is done to himſelf. When the underſtanding is weak, and not a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent guide, an injury may be done, altho' the party concerned be willing. But the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us is quite otherwiſe. Our Bleſſed Lord, upon the cleareſt dictate of reaſon, became willing to bear our ſins. He did in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the propenſities of his own benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſerve the neceſſities of Mankind; juſtifie publick Order; and aſſert the Majeſty of the Law, againſt all that contempt which our Sins had expoſed it unto.</p>
               <p>The Premiſes, being well conſidered, will make it manifeſt, That Chriſt ſuffered the puniſhment of our Sins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What He ſuffered was in our ſtead. This will be evident, if we conſider his blood
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49823:166"/>which he ſhed, either as a Sacrifice, or a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: as a Sacrifice. The offering which he made to God, was expiatory, <hi>a Sacrifice for ſin, Heb.</hi> 10.20. This oblation muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have the nature which is common to all offerings under the Old Teſtament of the ſame kind. They were figures of this great Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and there muſt be an agreement betwixt the Type and the thing typified, in that which is eſſential to the nature of the Type. Now, it is manifeſt, That all the expiatory offerings in the Old Teſtament, were in lieu of thoſe perſons, for whom they were offered. The Law did require death of every one, that did not remain in the obedience of it. The offences againſt it were of two ſorts, either ſuch as were puniſhed with the death of the offender, as Murder and Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Sacrifice: Or elſe ſuch, for the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, a Sacrifice was appointed, and ſlain in the room of the Tranſgreſſour. The blood of the beaſt, in which the life conſiſts, was given upon the Altar to make atonement for the Souls of Men, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.11. As the Law was ſatisfied by the death of the offender in the firſt caſe: So likewiſe, by the death of the Sacrifice in the ſecond. The ſin of the Delinquent was ſymbolically derived upon the Piacular Sacrifice, and therefore he which carried the skin and fleſh without the Camp, to be burnt, did, by touching of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract pollution, and might not be admitted into the Camp again, before he had waſhed his cloaths, and bathed his fleſh in water,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:49823:166"/>
                  <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.28. This was the cauſe, why he, for whom the offering was made, was obliged to lay his hand upon the head of it. <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſays, That the hand did import action, and ſignifie, That the actions of the Tranſgreſſour were laid upon the Sacrifice. This was the apprehenſion of the ancient <hi>Jews,</hi> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the form of words uſed, when a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering was made, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>haec ſit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatio mea,</hi> which they expound thus, <hi>The evil, which I have deſerved, let it fall upon the head of the Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, If the expiatory offerings under the Moſaical Oeconomy, were Types of the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, and it was eſſential to them, to be ſlain in the room of the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, we have juſt reaſon from hence to infer, That our bleſſed Lord ſuffered not only for our good and advantage, but in our ſtead, and place.</p>
               <p>In order to the diſappointing the force of this argument, <hi>Crellius</hi> ſays, That Chriſt was not a Prieſt till he came into Heaven; and that thoſe Sacrifices only, which were offered for the whole Congregation, and at ſome ſtated times, eſpecially, That upon the day of expiation, were Types of his oblation: and that thoſe which were deſigned for this uſe, did not repreſent him in his mactation; but in that one action only, whereby their blood was carried into the holy place, and ſprinkled before the Lord. To all which I will reply in order.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:49823:167"/>1. Chriſt did execute the office of a Prieſt here upon the earth. The Apoſtle ſays, he gave himſelf as an Offering and Sacrifice unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> imports ſuch a Sacrifice as is put to death, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 10. Reconciliation the proper effect of a Sacrifice, is attributed to the blood of the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. His purging our ſins did precede his ſitting down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. His having obtained eternal redemption, is antecedent to his entring into the holy place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. He is ſaid to be once offered up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. And after this to ſit down at the right hand of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. If this offering has been in Heaven, it would not have been ſaid to have been once done. The repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this oblation there is every day. He continually makes interceſſion. The offering, upon which the Apoſtles words have an aſpect, imports paſſion. For he ſays, in caſe it was to be repeated, then Chriſt muſt have often ſuffered ſince the foundation of the World: but the Paſſion of Chriſt was over, before he entred into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thoſe words, <hi>If he were on earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt, Heb.</hi> 8.4. do not imply, That he did not execute his Sacerdotal Function, when he was upon the earth. All, that can be collected from them, is, That if after he had made an offering upon the Croſs, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upon the earth, he could not have been our High-Prieſt: Becauſe, He, who was to bear this office, was not only to die for us
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49823:167"/>upon the Earth, but to appear in Heaven, and there by preſenting the merit of that oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was made here below, procure thoſe aids which we ſtand in need of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe Sacrifices, which were offered for the whole Congregation at ſome ſet times, were not the only Types of the offering of the Meſſias. The Apoſtle, when he tells us, That the Sacrifice of Chriſt was ſubſtituted in the room of the Legal Offerings; and that the firſt was taken away, that the ſecond might be eſtabliſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. He muſt neceſſarily have his eye upon ſuch oblations, which as if they were ſhadows, which, when the body came, did diſappear and vaniſh. Now it is plain, That the Apoſtle there, has his eye upon more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, than thoſe which were offered for the whole Congregation. He uſeth ſo many words as can comprehend no leſs than all the Moſaical Oblations, as Sacrifice, Offering, Burnt-offerings, Offering for ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not true, That thoſe Sacrifice which typified Chriſt, did repreſent him only in that action, whereby the blood was carried into the holy place, and ſprinkled before the Lord. The Apoſtle ſays, That the very burning their bodies without the Camp, was a Type of him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11, 12. <hi>for the bodies of thoſe beaſts, whoſe blood is brought into the ſanctuary by the high Prieſt for ſin, are burnt without the Camp. Therefore Jeſus alſo, that he might ſanctifie the people with his own blood, ſuffered without the Gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:49823:168"/>
               <p>There was nothing in the ceremonial conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution leſs probable to be in the number of the Types of the Law, than this circumſtance of place. The mactation has a more obvious correſpondence with the deſign of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And if that, which has the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of being in that number, was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding prefigurative and typical, much more that which has a greater.</p>
               <p>Now I have conſidered Chriſt under the notion of a Sacrifice. In the next place, if we look upon him as a Ranſome, it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that what he ſuffered, was in our ſtead.</p>
               <p>By Sin we brought our ſelves into a ſtate of bondage, under an obligation to undergo the penalty of the Law. The ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation was denounced againſt us, and we juridically bound to ſuffer. In order to the redeeming of us from this condition, Jeſus Chriſt has been pleaſed to lay down a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent price in our ſtead agreeable to the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law. This is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which includes both a commutation and a compenſation. It was laid down in the place of that which was due from us. Our Bleſſed Lord redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law by being made a curſe. He ſuffered that which was a valuable conſideration, and did anſwer all the ends of the legal Sanction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians,</hi> to diſappoint the ſtrength of this Argument, ſay, That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not taken properly. <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and yet he laid down no price, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Every
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49823:168"/>proper price is paid to ſome body. It could not be paid to God, becauſe he procured it: and thoſe, who are redeemed by it, are bought for his ſervice. He, for whom the redeemed are purchaſed, and who procures the price of redemption, doth not uſe to receive it. A price in a proper ſence would deſtroy the nature of remiſſion.</p>
               <p>To which I reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be not taken properly, then the blood of Chriſt is ſtiled a price only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the effuſion of it intervenes, before we are delivered from our bondage, as a price doth; altho' it hath no ſuch influence, as a price, upon our redemption. And if ſo, then ſome reaſon ought to be given, why our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is attributed more to the blood and death of Chriſt, than to his Doctrin, Miracles, Promiſes, the blood of Martyrs. All theſe have an influence upon our Salvation of the ſame nature with that which <hi>Crellius</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the blood of Chriſt. The Doctrin of Chriſt doth ſhew us the way to it. His Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles confirm the truth of that way. His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes excite us to walk in it. The blood of Martyrs, and their Heroick Patience, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently conduce to the eſtabliſhment of our Faith. If the blood of Chriſt did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our redemption, in ſome peculiar way, which is not common to theſe things, why is it never attributed to them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.37. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Type of the true Redeemer, and the blood of the Paſchal Lamb, a Type of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49823:169"/>the price of redemption which he laid down. It is no good conſequence, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> did not pay a price properly ſo called, therefore Chriſt did not. The ſimilitude betwixt the figure and the thing prefigured muſt not be extended beyond the bounds intended in the inſtitution, to every punctilio. <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Fiſh's belly was a Type of Chriſt in the grave. Becauſe <hi>Jonah</hi> was alive, it doth not follow, That Chriſt in the grave was not dead. The Brazen Serpent, when it was lifted up, was a Type of Chriſt Crucified. From thence we muſt not infer, That Chriſt's blood was not ſhed upon the Croſs, becauſe none did ſlow from the Brazen Serpet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The price of our redemption was paid unto god. He held us captive. The Apoſtle ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we were kept, (as priſoners in a garriſon) under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 23. By whoſe warrant, we were committed to this priſon, is expreſſed in the precedent verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Scripture hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, or ſhut up all under ſin. This Warrant was written with God's own hand. Parallel to this is what is expreſſed in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, God hath ſhut up all under diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, c.</hi> 11.32. We were impriſoned for our delinquency, and by a divine appointment under an obligation to ſuffer puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Tho' God procures the price, and the redeemed are ranſomed for his ſervice; yet it doth not follow, That the price was not paid to him. When a Subject violates the Law of his Prince, and by his enormous deportment
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49823:169"/>precipitates himſelf into a ſtate of thraldom; and it cannot be reconciled with the intereſt of the community, and the immutable rule of juſtice to ſet him at liberty, without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction firſt made to the Law: the Prince out of his benignity may contrive, how this may be done; and when it is done, accept it, and releaſe the perſon, with a deſign, that he may be in capacity to ſerve him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The price of Redemption, properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, doth not deſtroy the nature of Pardon and Remiſſion. He, on whom the Pardon is conferred, contributes nothing of his own to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the meriting of it. The debt is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, without any payment made by him to the Creditor. Forgiveneſs is an entire act of Divine Benignity. It is no diminution of the bounty of Heaven, to make choice of ſuch a way to do it in, as hath a conſiſtence with Wiſdom and Juſtice. There is more grace expreſſed in pardoning in and thro' Chriſt, than in pardoning without him. Immediate Remiſſion is but a ſingle favour, Remiſſion in and thro' Chriſt, a double. For God doth not only pardon ſin, but give his own Son for the procuring of it in ſuch a method, as contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes no inferiour degree of glory to every attributed in the Divine Eſſence; and is equally advantageous to the tranſgreſſour.</p>
               <p>All this, duely conſidered, will evidence, That our Bleſſed Lord ſuffered in our ſtead.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By what, He ſuffered in our ſtead, the damage done by ſin is repaired; and the mind of the Supreme Rector fully appeaſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:49823:170"/>unto us upon the terms of the New Covenant. The damage is repaired. By pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment Laws are vindicated, and their juſt authority aſſerted. The greater the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, the clearer is the vindication. There cannot be a greater penalty, than That, which was ſuffered by the Son of God. Penalties are eſtimated according tot he dignity of the perſon, who ſuffers. It is a higher puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a Prince to have marks of diſgrace faſtned upon him, than for a Peaſant. Our Bleſſed Lord infinitely tranſcending all others in dignity, there maſt be a kind of infinity in that penalty, which was laid upon him. Now what can be more efficacious than this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all contempt from the Laws, and put a check upon that aptitude which is in Men, to take encouragement from a bad example, to violate them. Who dare lightly think of that, the vindication of which coſt no leſs than the Death of the Lord of Life? That Authority will not eaſily be diſvalued, when it is manifeſt, That the crime, in neglecting of it, was expiated upon no eaſier terms, than the Paſſion of the Son of God. Who will not be afraid to affront that Order, which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom has eſtabliſhed; when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the drops of Blood, which fell from the face of our Bleſſed Lord; the wounds, which were made in the moſt nervous parts of his Body; the greatneſs of the Agony which he ſuffered.</p>
               <p>As the damage done by Sin to the Laws is repaired by the Paſſion of Chriſt; ſo likewiſe
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49823:170"/>the mind of the Supreme Rector is fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and reconciled. A Reconciliation is attributed to his ſufferings in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. This reconciliation muſt import a reconciliation of God unto us. The Apoſtle in his Epiſt. to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeaks of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the atonement, <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 11. We then receive it, when we lay aſide our enmity, and are converted unto God; and therefore this atonement muſt be made, before our enmity be depoſited. The thing received is always antecedent to the act of receiving, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it can import nothing but God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to us by the Blood of Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we comply with the terms of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, of which he is the Mediator. For this reaſon, mention is made of <hi>a reconciliation thro' the blood of the Croſs, Col.</hi> 1.20. And then after follows another reconciliation, when we ceaſe to be <hi>enemies in our minds to God, v.</hi> 21. parallel to this is what is expreſſed 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> And then <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>We pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled unto God.</hi> Here are evidently Two Reconciliations, One of God unto us, in caſe we perform the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the New Covenant: The Other of us unto God, when we are converted. Then that Reconciliation, which was before conditional, becomes abſolute, and we fully ſtated in the poſſeſſion of the Divine favour. Now this reconciliation of God unto us, can import no leſs, than that his mind is fully ſatisfied, and his diſpleaſure appeaſed in conſideration of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49823:171"/>the Sufferings of Chriſt. Upon this account our Bleſſed Lord is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. He is a cover to the Law, and prevents the Penal part of it from being executed upon us. He is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a propitiation for our ſins.</hi> God is made by his precious blood <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>hilaris,</hi> or chearful in his countenance, when he looks upon a ſinner. He who before was angry, is now propitious. His righteouſneſs being declared, and the authority of his Law, as fully vindicated by the Paſſion of Chriſt, as if we had ſuffered: He is ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented upon the terms of the Goſpel to make us the objects of his favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crellius</hi> in oppoſition to what has been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, affirms, 1. That the Apoſtle in his Ep. to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Converſion;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Converſion</hi> expreſſeth only the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable temper of our minds towards God, he uſeth the word, <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> to import, That if there be a friendſhip wanting on God's part by reaſon of our hoſtility to him in an unconverted ſtate, it is then when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, fully completed. 2. The Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Celoſſians</hi> cannot ſpeak of a reconciliation of God unto us in a proper ſence, becauſe in the reconciliation there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned things in Heaven are concerned, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Good Angels, who were never in a ſtate of enmity to God. 3. When the Apoſtle ſays in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, That God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Ep. 5.18, 19.</note> the meaning is, That God did promote Converſion by the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49823:171"/>as afterwards he did by the Preaching of the Apoſtles. 4. When Chriſt is ſaid to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, the word cannot import any pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Divine Anger. The love of God in ſending Chriſt, evidently demonſtrates a reconciliation antecedent to the miſſion and coming of Chriſt into the world.</p>
               <p>To all which I reply in order. 1. The granting, That the word <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is uſed with a deſign to expreſs, That if there be any friendſhip wanting on God's part, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted at our <hi>Converſion,</hi> is a conceſſion of the whole cauſe. The Spirit of God, doth not uſe to ſpeak conjecturally. He has a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of all the Myſtery of Godlineſs. Had he not known, That there is a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of God unto us, as well as of us unto God, he would not have uſed a word with a deſign to expreſs ſo much. Now this reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not imputed to converſion, but the Death of the Son of God as the procuring cauſe: and therefore to receive the atonement can be nothing but to receive the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and friendſhip of God, which is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt. 2. By Things in Heaven there is no neceſſity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Angels. There were Men in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as Angels, who had been in a ſtate of enmity to God. Theſe, God was reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto, by the Blood of his Son, when they were upon the earth; and now they were in a ſtate of fruition, reaping the advantages of his atonement. 3. When the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:49823:172"/>ſomething more muſt be meant, than the promoting Converſion by the preaching Chriſt. Our Bleſſed Lord did not preach unto the World, but <hi>to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> If the reconciling by Chriſt did import no more, than the converting of Men by his Preaching, then it might have been as well ſaid, That God was in the Apoſtles <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world unto himſelf.</hi> It will be difficult to prevail with any to believe, That there is not ſomething peculiar in this expreſſion, which cannot with juſtice to the honour of our Redeemer be attributed to any other. 4. The Love of God in ſending Chriſt is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a reconciliation in God antecedent to the ſufferings of Chriſt. When ſo much love was expreſſed to <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two friends, as to appoint <hi>Job</hi> to be an Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour for them, and to direct them to offer up Seven Bullocks and Seven Rams: <hi>at that very time the wrath of God was kindled againſt them.</hi> The Plague, an undoubted teſtimony of divine diſpleaſure, was at that time upon <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> when God ſent his Prophet to inſtruct <hi>David,</hi> how to ſtop the ſpreading of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. All, which can be reaſonably deduced from the miſſion of Chriſt, is a deſign or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be reconciled, and not an actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
               <p>And now if we look back, and conſider That Chriſt ſuffered the puniſhment of our ſin; what he ſuffered was in our ſtead: By his Sufferings, the damage done by ſin is repaired, and the mind of the Supreme Rector fully
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49823:172"/>reconciled, the verity of the third Propoſition will be evident, That a full and complete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is made by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our acceptance with God is upon the account of this meritorious ſatisfaction. It ſets believers free from the Curſe of the Law. The Curſe of the Law doth include the loſs of the Divine Favour. That which frees us from this malediction, muſt neceſſarily reſtore us to our acceptation with God. The ranſome laid down by our Redeemer as it has an aſpect upon the juſtice of Heaven, is ſaid to ſatisfie; as it ſtands in relation to thoſe benefits, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures for us, to merit: So that our acceptance is upon the account of the meritorious ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our Bleſſed Lord. Therefore, S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, That <hi>God hath made us accepted in the beloved, Epb.</hi> 1.6. and S. <hi>Peter</hi> repreſents our Spiritual Services <hi>to be acceptable to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Of this truth there are very early ſignifications.<note place="margin">

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49823:173"/>the fairer proſpect that way. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſay, That in the fire, whereby God did declare his acceptance of their Sacrifices, there was the appearance of a Lyon, to ſignifie, That it was <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Judah,</hi> which procured them an intereſt in the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our acceptance with God is only upon the account of the meritorions ſatisfaction of his Bleſſed Son. As he has troden the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alone: So the honour of meriting for us is peculiar to him. The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> indeed ſpeak of the merits of Saints, and are not contented to attribute to them, ſo much only, as is expedient for themſelves: but aſſert an overplus, which being blended with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of the merits of Chriſt, and laid up in a Treaſury, are the ground and foundation of the Papal Indulgencies. But he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the true notion of Merit, will eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all this to be but a fiction. It imports a dignity in the work adequate to the reward. In the choiceſt of thoſe ſervices, which they perform, who arrive at the greateſt degree of Sanctity, no ſuch worth can be found. If it may, it muſt be either innate, or derived from without. It cannot be the firſt, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is no leſs than God himſelf, under the fulleſt diſcloſures of his Goodneſs; and none of the moſt Heroick performances, can indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be equal to him.<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> If the Paſſions and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of this Life are not worthy to ſtand in competition, and be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed, much leſs the actions.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49823:173"/>There can be no action more noble, than with alacrity of mind, to ſuffer what the profeſſion of Religion may expoſe us to.</p>
               <p>If it be acquired Worth, derived from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without, it muſt be either from the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Grace, the Spirit of God, the Merit of Chriſt, or the Promiſe. All theſe are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> as the fountain of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not from the Habit of Grace. Altho' as it deſcends from the Father of lights, it is a good and perfect gift; yet conſidered with relation to the Recipient, into which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends, and out of which it does not expel all the remains of the Primitive Apoſtaſy, it is but imperfect. Now it acting as a quality of this ſubject, it is impoſſible, that it ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt its operations with the higheſt degree of perfection. Nothing can communicate to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other That, which it has not in it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not from the Spirit, which excites and moves the Soul to act according to the Habit. If any ſuch value be imparted, the Spirit in the communication muſt act as a neceſſary, or a free Cauſe. Not as a neceſſary; for then every Religious action will be meritorious: there is no good, but the Spirit of God contributes to the production of it, and a neceſſary cauſe is uniform in all its effects. Not as a free cauſe; For if it is not the will of the Holy Spirit to inveſt us in this life with ſuch a meaſure of Grace, as will prevent all ſinful defects: We have more than a uſual preſumption, That it is not his pleaſure to impreſs ſuch a dignity upon our ſervices, as is proportionable to
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:49823:174"/>the eternal reward in the life to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not from the Merit of Chriſt. If he has merited, That we may merit; then his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings communicate to our Services either a finite, or infinite value. If a finite only, then they cannot merit that infinite love, which our acceptance ſuppoſeth. Finite worth is not commenſurate to an unlimited and infinite reward. If infinite, then the works of Holy Men are not inferiour in perfection to the Works of Chriſt; infinity will admit of no degrees. A work which is finite in reſpect of the Principle, from whence it proceeds, has not capacity enough to receive and entertain boundleſs dignity. The Ocean may as well be included within the confines of a ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Chriſt has procured for us a power to do well, and acceptance for thoſe actions, which flow from that power; but not a power to merit. The nature of a meer creature is not reconcileable with ſuch an immunity. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not under the greateſt elevation do any ſervice, but that, which God may challenge as a juſt debt, and the notion of Merit includes and imports ſomething which is not due.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Not from the Promiſe. The Promiſe doth not communicate any excellency to the Work, but ſuppoſeth it to be in its perfection. In the Old Covenant, <hi>Do this, and live; Do,</hi> which imports the work, is the Antecedent, <hi>Live,</hi> which is the promiſe of compenſation, the Conſequent. The Conſequent cannot be the Cauſe of any thing in the Antecedent. If the Promiſe raiſes the value and dignity of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49823:174"/>the Work, then the larger the Promiſe is, the greater will the value of the Work be: which aſſertion runs the maintainers of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an inevitable contradiction, for the more large the Promiſe is, the greater is the Mercy of Heaven: and the more value there is in the ſervice, the leſs mercy and kindneſs there is in the reward. Now if the amplitude of the Promiſe adds a value to the performance, Mercy will be the leaſt, where it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. All this doth manifeſt, That there is no Merit in us to be a rival with the meritorious ſatisfaction of Chriſt in procuring the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our perſons and ſervices with God. And if there be no merit at all in the Saints, there cannot be an overplus to be laid up by the Church in a Treaſury. We cannot expect a tide, where there is no water. We may with as little violence to our reaſon believe, That one drop of water in a deep channel may ſwell above the banks and fill the ditches on all hands; as that the works of Men may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the bounds of the Law, and fill the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Repoſitory.</p>
               <p>What is uſually ſaid, concerning the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of the Merit of Chriſt, is of no moment to help the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in the preſent caſe. His infinite Merit is not of ſuch a nature, as that part of it may be expended one way, and the reſt laid up in a Treaſury. For that, which may be divided, has parts, and every part muſt be either finite or infinite. If the merit of Chriſt may be divided into finite parts it is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them: and that, which is compoſed of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:49823:175"/>finite, cannot be infinite. If into infinite, then every part is equal to the whole. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bigger than that which is infinite. The truth is, every good Man is accepted and ſaved by the whole merit of Jeſus Chriſt. As infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Merit is ſufficient to procure the Divine Favour for the whole World: So no leſs will purchaſe it for any particular perſon. Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence is requiſite for the creating of the Firmament, and no leſs is neceſſary to the making of one Star. A <hi>Romaniſt</hi> may with as much reaſon conceive, becauſe the infinite power, whereby this World is made, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make a thouſand more; That he may treaſure up the overplus, and iſſue it forth at pleaſure, for the creating another World: as, becauſe the infinite Merit of Chriſt is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the redeeming and procuring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for more, than it does; therefore ſome of it may be laid up in a reconditory at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Papal Repoſitory is not unlike the Tomb of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> which <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis</hi> opened with a great expectation of Treaſure. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth much without, but when looked into, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be found but vacuity and emptineſs.</p>
               <p>All this doth demonſtrate, That indulgence and favour from God is to be expected only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of the meritorious ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt. The evidence for this doctrin is ſo clear, That <hi>Bellarmine</hi> who ſet forth, like the Son of <hi>Peor,</hi> with a full purpoſe to curſe it, was forced to bleſs it with a <hi>tutiſſimum eſt,</hi> That it is the moſt ſafe to rely only upon the Merits of our Bleſſed Lord.</p>

We have a ſtated rule for private Worſhip. <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet.</hi> There we may take an impartial account of our ſincerity. The Eye of the Spectator, like a Burning-glaſs, doth often kindle the fire of publick Devotion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As parts of a Family, And ſo we are obliged to joyn with thoſe with whom we live in an Oeconomical ſtate. Every Maſter of a Family is inveſted with a Domeſtick Power. His Authority over his Children is founded in generation: over others in a tacit or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit compact. This Power he is bound to uſe to the utmoſt, in promoting the Glory of the Supreme Being. In every Society the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:49823:176"/>chief Governour lies under the ſtricteſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to advance this end. He cannot be ſaid to do this, except he exerts it ſometimes in the engaging thoſe who are under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection to perform ſuch duties as have the moſt direct and immediate aſpect upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honour. And there is no way more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious to do this in, than the joyning with them in Prayers and Supplication to Almighty God. Upon this account we read of Family-Worſhip amongſt thoſe, who had only the conduct of Natural light. The Heathens had their <hi>Penates,</hi> which were placed in the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of the houſe, to which their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was daily directed. <hi>Demipho</hi> in <hi>Terence</hi> ſays, <hi>Ego Deos penates hinc ſalutatum domum divortar.</hi> I will from hence ſtep aſide to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the houſhold-gods. <hi>Salutatum, Donatus</hi> interprets <hi>adoratum prece,</hi> to adore by Prayer. They likewiſe had their <hi>Lares. Lar</hi> is a God, <hi>qui domi à familia colebatur,</hi>

               <p>In the Holy Scriptures we read of a ſignal act of Religion in the firſt family. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> brought their Sacrifices. This is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a pattern to future generations. The firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born of <hi>Noah</hi>'s poſterity was devoted to this ſacred purpoſe.

               <p n="1">1. The Nature of the Church.</p>
               <p>Every one who is admitted into it, enters into a Corporation. The Church is ſtiled a Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. The Members of every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration are not only to be engaged in ſuch ſolitary acts, as relate to themſelves in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate capacity: but lie under an obligation to meet together for the performance of ſuch common offices, as concern the utility of the whole. There is no Community, that has not ſome ſolemn place appointed for the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Members of it. 2. Chriſt's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of publick Paſtours and Teachers. The deſign of this Ordination is to edifie his body; if the ſeveral parts of this body do not convene, in order to the receiving the inſtruction of theſe Teachers, the end of this Holy Inſtitution will be totally diſappointed. 3. His Ordinances, as Baptiſm, The Supper of the Lord, Excommunication, Abſolution; All theſe ſuppoſe the Duty of aſſembling pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49823:177"/>By the Firſt, We gain a right to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion. In the Second, We have an enjoyment of it. The Third imports an excluſion from it. The Fourth, a re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to it. 4. The ſecurity of his Diſciples. Thoſe who conſcientiouſly frequent publick aſſemblies have a promiſe, That <hi>God will be a ſun and a ſhield to them, Pſal.</hi> 84.11. They have the protection of good Angels. The Walls of the Temple were carved with Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims, to ſignifie their ſurrounding them as a Guard to defend them from danger. They are not ſo much expoſed to the aſſaults of the Infernal Spirit. The Devil made choice of the Wilderneſs as the moſt advantageous place to ſet upon our Saviour in. When we are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with others, we are not with ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility broken by the force of an adverſary, as when alone. Such aſſemblies are a good ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt Apoſtaſie. The Apoſtle inſinuates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. That the deſerting the Church, is the next door to the deſertion of the Faith. The Zeal of thoſe, whom we have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with, is of excellent uſe to repair the decaies of our Love. Coals put together keep one another a-live, which a-ſunder would quickly die. 5. The Glory of God. We then glorifie him, when we manifeſt and ſet forth the peerleſs perfections of his Nature. The fuller this manifeſtation is, the more Glory muſt neceſſarily accrue to him. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be more full and clear in a joynt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Religious duties, than in ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry devotion. This made it ſo deſirable to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49823:178"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> to go with a multitude to <hi>the Houſe of God.</hi> The practice of the People of God in all Ages, Before the Law, Under the Law, After the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before the Law, We read of Publick Places ſet apart for this Sacred purpoſe. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> erected an Altar betwixt <hi>Aai</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Under the Law, Mention is made of the Tabernacle, High Places, Temple, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuchas, Synagogues.</p>
               <p>Tabernacle. This was ſet up at <hi>Shilo, Joſ.</hi> 18.1. And becauſe of the aſſembling of the People, ſtiled the Tabernacle of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. This together with the Ark, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there from the fourteenth year of <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s government, until the death of <hi>Eli,</hi> the High-Prieſt. When the Ark was taken captive, and prophaned by the unhallowed hands of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> a liberty was granted for the erection of Altars upon high places, like to that which <hi>Gideon</hi> built upon a Rock, upon an extraordinary occaſion, <hi>Jud.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> In <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth</hi> the City of <hi>Samuel</hi> there was ſuch a high place where the Sacrifice of the People
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49823:178"/>was offered up If this had been contrary to the mind of God, no queſtion but <hi>Samuel,</hi> who as a Prophet had knowledge to underſtand his Will, and as a Judge Power to execute it, and is upon record as a perſon who was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the diſcharge of his duty, would have exerted his authority in the demolition of it. The like we read of in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> where the Ark and Tabernacle were, which <hi>Moſes</hi> made in the Wilderneſs. The cenſure paſſed upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> and the ſucceeding Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> upon the account of the high places, doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That it was a ſin to frequent them in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s time, and part of <hi>David</hi>'s reign. For when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were infeſted with the Plague, <hi>David</hi> was directed to rear an Altar in the threſhing Floor of <hi>Araunah</hi> in order to the appeaſing of the Divine diſpleaſure. When he had done what he was enjoyned, and was bleſſed in his action with that ſucceſs which he deſired, he being under the guidance of the Holy Spirit declared, That was the place of the divine <hi>Schecina. This is the houſe of the Lord God, and this is the offering for the burnt offering of</hi> Iſrael, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 1. From that time it became a fault to have recourſe to the High Places. <hi>Solomon</hi> being young, when this command was given, did forget it when he went to <hi>Gibeon:</hi> His offence, tho' recorded, yet was pardoned, and his requeſt fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>After the Tabernacle we read of the Temple. In order to the performance of the Service of God in it, the Prieſts were digeſted into
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49823:179"/>Four and Twenty Courſes, in their ſeveral Courſes they gave their attendance for a whole week together. There they Prayed, Sang Praiſes, read the Commandments, Offered up the daily Sacrifice for all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As one Courſe did enter upon the Sabbath, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went forth, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.5, 7. So that within leſs than the ſpace of half a year it came to the turn of the ſame Perſons to wait. It was lawful for all the Courſes to be preſent together at the Three great Feaſts, with this caution, That they only to whom it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to attend that Week, might offer up the Free-will Offerings, and the Daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>

                  <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> uſe the word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> in the ſence which we contend for. Such a place is ſtiled <hi>Domus Dei</hi> in <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and <hi>Dominicum</hi> in S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Theſe words import a reſignation of the right which the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:49823:181"/>owner was veſted in, and a ſolemn appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation to the ſervice of our Bleſſed Lord.</p>
               <p>There is all the reaſon imaginable, why there ſhould be ſuch conveniences for the Chriſtians in thoſe early times. They were paſſionate in their deſires to propagate their Religion. Known places for their Aſſemblies were ſignally conducing to this end. Every one might have recourſe to them, to gain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in the Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſeverity of the Age, was not ſuch as always to hinder them from building. It was as great againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> At firſt, The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were perſecuted under that name, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.2. And yet they had their Synagogues in divers places. From <hi>Julius</hi> to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great are reckoned above Forty Emperours and Ten Perſecutions. In the intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe violent ſtorms, there is no reaſon to believe, but that the Chriſtians might erect appropriate places for the Worſhip of Chriſt. The <hi>Greeks</hi> at this day, tho' they live under ſeverities not unequal to thoſe, which the Primitive Chriſtians were exerciſed with: yet have their Churches allowed them.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral ſteps which the Penitents were to take before they could be admitted to the Communion, is an evident demonſtration of that which we argue for. Firſt, They muſt ſtand without the doors of the Oratory, and there with the greateſt importunity, beg the Prayers of thoſe, who went in and came out of it. Theſe were named <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. After this part of their penance was finiſhed, they
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:49823:182"/>were admitted within the doors, and ſtood in the place called the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The next ſtep was to that part of the Church which was behind the <hi>Ambo,</hi> or Pulpit. Theſe did hear as the former, and went out with the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and were termed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The next ſtep was their ſtanding and remaining together with the Faithful, and communicating in Prayers, and Pſalms: but not in the Holy Sacrament. Theſe were known by the title of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. All this can argue no leſs than, That the Chriſtians did not promiſcuouſly meet in any place, but had peculiar Edifices, digeſted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts ſuitable to theſe ends. This way of diſcipline was earlier than the times of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Neo-Caeſaria.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as a thing which the Church had been fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly accuſtomed to, and He flouriſhed about the middle of the Third Century.</p>
               <p>The Conceſſion of <hi>Origen, Minutius Foelix, Arnobius, Lactantius,</hi> That the Chriſtians had no Temples, is no prejudice to what has been aſſerted. Theſe Authors lived within the Third Century. In that age we have evident Teſtimonies for peculiar places dedicated to Chriſtian Worſhip. Therefore by the Temples which the Chriſtians had not, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſuch as were in uſe amongſt the Heathens, namely, Edifices in which ſome <hi>Daemon</hi> was encloſed, and kept from wandring abroad by Magical incantations.</p>

               <p>After the Three firſt Centuries were paſt, we have a cloud of Witneſſes.

               <p>In after ages, None doubt whether there were ſuch places, or no. All the queſtion is, Whether they may be uſed now, by reaſon of thoſe abuſes, which have been formerly practiſed in them, the too much Sanctity which ſome continue to attribute to them.</p>

               <p>To which I reply, 1. Former abuſes can be no juſt ground for our not frequenting of them. The corruptions are removed by the Reformation, as the Buyers and Sellers were whipt out of the Temple.</p>
               <p>Superſtition doth not like the Leproſie in Houſes, ſo cleave to the Walls, as not to be ſeparated without pulling them down. The introduction of the True Worſhip of Chriſt, doth as naturally remove it, as Light expells Darkneſs.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:49823:185"/>of the ancient Chriſtians, who weekly faſted upon the daies, when Chriſt was betrayed and Cruciſied, yearly before the Paſſeover. There were likewiſe in uſe among them So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Days appointed to perpetuate the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Martyrs, and the goodneſs of God in furniſhing them with magnanimity, to give ſo ſignal a teſtimony of the reality of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe ſtated days occaſioned by ſome particular diſpenſations, reaſon doth ſuggeſt unto us, That there ought to be a ſolemn time peculiarly devoted to the honour of <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> have their particular days ſet apart to preſerve their memory, and thoſe honourable thoughts in us, which their holy and exemplary converſation deſerves: certainly God doth juſtly challenge a peculiar time to be Conſecrated to the remembrance and Adoration of his peerleſs Perfection, tranſcendent Dominion, and unparallel'd Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>The Wiſe Man tells us,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.1.</note>

For this is the great purpoſe which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in the New Creation; That he may have a choſen Generation, to ſhew forth the Praiſes of him, <hi>Who hath brought them out of darkneſs, into his marvellous light.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:49823:185"/>
               <p>Upon this account the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had not only their daily Sacrifice Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their Yearly Solemnities where the Males appeared: but likewiſe a Solemn Day every Week, when all of both Sex were obliged to own the Soveraignty of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and their relation as Subjects to him. Therefore their Sabbath is repreſented as a ſign, That <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> was their God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.20. Earthly Princes are not only owned by the daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which the Court gives unto them, by the occaſional obeyſance of their Subjects, upon the account of ſome particular favours: but likewiſe there is uſually a fixed and ſtated Time for the payment of that homage whereby their Supremacy is owned. It is as reaſonable, that there ſhould be as ſolemn and peculiar Times for all the Subjects of <hi>Jehovah</hi> to make their due acknowledgments, and render their tribute of Honour and Worſhip to him.</p>
               <p>The Heathens by the light of Nature,<note place="margin">Macrob. Saturn. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi> p. <hi>226</hi>
                  </note> were directed not only to appoint the <hi>dies interciſi,</hi> which were but in part devoted to the honour of their Deities, but likewiſe a more ſolemn time, which was entirely dedicated to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That this moſt Solemn Time may be the better underſtood, I will lay down the following Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God requires, That we give to him, not only a Mental and inward Worſhip, but that we expreſs it by external actions. Our Bodies as well as our Souls being made and redeemed
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:49823:186"/>by him: we cannot but lie under an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable obligation to Worſhip and Glorifie him with both.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Our external acknowledgments of the Divine Majeſty muſt not only be in private, but in publick: Not only when we are alone, but in Communion and conjunction with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For we undoubtedly are bound to Worſhip the Fountain of all our Bleſſings in ſuch a way, as hath the moſt direct and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious influence upon the promotion of his Honour. His Honour is more advanced by the joint and united performances of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, than by their ſolitary devotions. For the more manifeſt and full, our Religious acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments are, the more Honour muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily accrue to him. And we cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Agnition is more full, and apert, when holy Men joyn together in their Sacred Addreſſes, than when they act a-ſunder, and confine themſelves to their ſeveral apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Solemn Time for theſe joynt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of Religion ought to be ſtated and fixt by ſome known conſtitution, otherwiſe, How ſhall the ſeveral members of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Community know, when to convene in order to the diſcharge of their duty?</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It is expedient, That it ſhould be taken out of ſome part of a Week. For our Souls naturally being under an indiſpoſition to the concerns of Religion, the ſooner the time for Solemn Worſhip returns, the more uſeful it will be, in preventing that deadneſs, which
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49823:186"/>will be apt to ſurpriſe us, before a larger Circle (ſuch as a Year, or Month) can come about.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It cannot in reaſon be leſs than one whole Day every Week, which will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we conſider, 1. The Object of our Worſhip. Were we to live the days of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſalem,</hi> he might challenge every moment of our time, as a juſt debt: and if all be due, reaſon will not allow, That ſo conſiderable a portion, as a Week, ſhould paſs without a ſolemn dedication of a Seventh part of it, to his ſervice. Let us ſuppoſe one man to owe unto anothers, as much or more, than his whole eſtate is worth, the rule of equity will not allow him to offer leſs than the Seventh part in order to the compounding his debt, and the juſt ſatisfaction of his Creditor. 2. The Nature of Worſhip. In it the Glory of God, the eternal happineſs of the Soul, the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral felicity of the Community are highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted. The difficulty in the right diſcharge of it is equal to the importance. The Prince of this World, makes it his work to hinder it. The natural tempers of Men, furniſh him with a ſignal advantage to compaſs his deſign. There is an inbred Love in us to ſenſible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which are apt to ingenerate <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </note> This is the reaſon why the Second Commandment, which relates to Worſhip, is fortified with ſo many inducements to obedience. One taken from the power of God to puniſh offenders, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. A Third from the execution of his Will upon the off-ſpring of thoſe which offend, <hi>viſiting the iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> A Fourth from his kindneſs to the obedient, <hi>ſhewing mercy, &amp;c.</hi> Had it not been difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our ſelves within the bounds of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, the fence, which is ſet about it, would not have been ſo ſtrong. If the Worſhip of God be a matter of ſuch difficulty, and of the greateſt importance, then it requires a very large proportion of our time, to be ſpent in the performance of it: and if ſo, was it left to our own diſpoſal, we could not in juſtice, allot leſs than the Seventh part. 3. The pattern of the triumphant Church. In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a perpetual Sabbath is celebrated. The glorified Spirits are conſtantly imployed in <hi>worſhipping him, who liveth for ever and ever, Rev.</hi> 4.10. This heavenly example the Church Militant muſt makes as near an approach unto as the circumſtances of this preſent life will permit, ſhe being obliged to endeavour, <hi>That the will of God may be done on earth, as it is in heaven, Matt.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 10. Thoſe who are moſt exerciſed with the incumbrances of this world, have nothing to plead in their own behalf, why they may not come up ſo nigh to this celeſtial pattern, as to devote One Day of every Week to the concerns of Religion. 4. The practice of the Militant Church, not only under the Law but before. From the beginning of the Creation, the Time for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Worſhip was no leſs than One whole Day every Week, as is evident from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:49823:187"/>of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> altho' the works were finiſhed from the foundation of the world. For he ſpake in a certain place of the Seventh Day on this wiſe, <hi>And God did reſt the ſeventh day, from all his works, Heb.</hi> 4.3, 4. Here is an evident remembrance of a day of reſt, not only to God but to Men. For the deſign of the Apoſtle is to prove, out of the 95. <hi>Pſal.</hi> That there remains a reſt to the people of God under the Goſpel. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this purpoſe, he ſhews it is not the reſt of the Seventh from the Creation which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had his eye upon. If the Seventh here mentioned, had not been a reſt to the people of God, but only to God himſelf, there would have been no neceſſity of ſuch care to diſtinguiſh it from that other reſt, which is concluded ſtill to remain to the people of God. 2. That time is expreſſed when this reſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, <hi>from the foundation of the world.</hi> The works then finiſhed are repreſented as the ground, upon which the Sabbath was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. It cannot with reaſon be imagined, That the foundation ſhould be laid at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the ſuperſtruction not built upon it (as ſome think) till above Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years after.</p>
               <p>This Aſſertion receives a great deal of ſtrength from the early diviſion of Time into Weeks. <hi>Noah</hi> had his eye upon the Hebdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madal Cycle, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.10, 12. A Week is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a period familiarly known in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.27. God himſelf did point out this diviſion by his own example, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:49823:188"/>the Six Days by peculiar Works, the Seventh by reſt. A univerſal conſent prevailed amongſt all the Eaſtern Nations about this particular. The teſtimony of <hi>Joannes Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is known,<note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that the diviſion into Months and Years, is of later date. <hi>Joſephus</hi> againſt <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. If the diviſion of Time into Weeks was from the beginning, and a week conſiſted of ſeven days, and one of thoſe were a Sabbath, or a day of reſt, the Sabbath muſt needs be from the beginning. There is no record, which makes mention of a week, that doth not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Sabbath to be a part of it, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:49823:188"/>firſt Man ſang on the Sabbath-day, and upon the firſt verſe of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> the firſt Song <hi>Adam</hi> ſpake at the time when his ſin was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and the day of the Sabbath came and protected him. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> are ſaid to bring their Sacrifices <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Indeed it is objected; That if the Sabbath was ſo early, as hath been repreſented, it would have been obſerved by the Patriarchs, and the celebration of it recorded in the book of <hi>Geneſis:</hi> and that the <hi>Jews</hi> are generally of opinion that it was not inſtituted, till after the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were delivered out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> To which, I reply, That <hi>Geneſis</hi> is but a ſhort Hiſtory, and it cannot be expected, That all things done by thoſe Holy Men ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8.</note> The Law againſt Polygamy was from the beginning, and yet it is paſſed over in ſilence in that Hiſtory, and not to be found, but in obſcure expreſſions throughout the Old Teſtament. There is no doubt, but there was a poſitive Law concerning Sacrifice, as early as the day of <hi>Abel,</hi> who is ſaid <hi>by Faith to offer up his oblation, Heb.</hi> 11. And yet the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it is not extant in <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' many of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aſſert the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to be inſtituted after the coming out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Yet others every jot as conſiderable,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:49823:189"/>as they, give it an earlier date, as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt, <hi>Joſephus, Philo Judaeus, Manaſſe Ben Iſrael,</hi> and upon far better reaſons.</p>
               <p>It is not always the Major part (where we have a freedom of judgment) but the Senior, which muſt be our guide: and which is ſo, we may diſcern by the ſolidity of the grounds, which the teſtimony is built upon.</p>
               <p>From all this it appears, That the ſolemn time for Worſhip, before the coming of Chriſt, even from the beginning, was no leſs, than one whole Day in a week: and if it was ſo frequent before his manifeſtation in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſignal effuſion of the Spirit, when the Sun of Righteouſneſs was not many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above the Horizon, it ought not to be leſs frequent among us, who are bleſſed with the enjoyment of fuller diſcloſures. It is a rule which S <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> gives, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. It behoveth us to ſhew forth the more virtue, becauſe the grace of the Spirit hath been poured out in larger meaſures.</p>
               <p>It would be a bad requital, If we who have the fruition of more Spiritual Bleſſings than the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould be leſs frequent than they were in thoſe acts, which have the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aſpect upon the Divine Honour.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That no leſs than the Seventh part of a Week ought to be devoted to the Solemn Worſhip of God, we may collect from the writings of the Heathens. They ſpeak of a Seventh Day every Week, which they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sacred. Teſtimonies of this nature are
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:49823:189"/>produc'd out of <hi>Linus</hi> by <hi>Ariſtobulus,</hi>

It is not a feaſt only of one City, and Region, but of all, and may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and worthily ſtiled a univerſal ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Birth-day of the World. Altho' at the firſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did derive this notion from the <hi>Hebrews</hi> by Tradition; yet had it not been very conſonant to the light of reaſon, it would not have met with ſo univerſal an entertainment.

The <hi>Romans,</hi> who had conquered them, finding their Religion, in worſhipping one God, was a condemnation of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to a plurality of Deities, they were highly exaſperated againſt them, and faſtened upon this particular of bodily reſt, to diſgrace them, repreſenting as tho' the ſeventh part of their time was ſpent in ſloth and idleneſs,

                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:49823:190"/>Theſe Two conſiderations make it plain, That altho' the Heathens did devote one day every week to the honour of their Supreme God, yet they might repreſent the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath as a rite peculiar to a <hi>Jew:</hi> the Jewiſh day being not the ſame with theirs, and the manner of the celebration quite different. This may be the cauſe, why the Lord's-day was by thoſe of them who were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, received without the leaſt ſcruple, an ancient cuſtom had made it fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them; the alteration was only in the object. Before it was dedicated to the Sun: now to the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And now I have finiſhed the Fifth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, The chief Solemn Time for Worſhip, ought to be no leſs, than One whole Day in every Week.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. It is highly reaſonable to believe, That the ſetting out the juſt Time ſhould be left to the Supreme Being. Tho' he has granted to the Church a liberty to appoint days for Mourning, and Rejoycing, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional emergencies, as is evident by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Ages: Yet there is all the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of reaſon to incline us to think, That he has reſerved to himſelf the appointment of the chief Solemn Time for the agnition of his Soveraignty, and Dominion over us. He alone ſet forth this Time at the beginning. Tho' he might have created the World in a moment: Yet, for our inſtruction, and better information about this great concern, he was pleaſed to work Six Days and reſt One, and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:49823:191"/>ſet it apart for his Worſhip and Service. This peculiar right he challengeth to himſelf in the Fourth Precept of the Decalogue. <hi>Six Days ſhalt thou labour, but the Seventh is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord thy God,</hi> That is a Day of his own deſignation and appointment. In the New Teſtament our Bleſſed Saviour is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Lord of the Sabbath, which can import no leſs, than that he has an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power to determine it, and that none have authority to alter what he is pleaſed to do. It is an evident injury to attempt to meddle with that, of which another is the Lord, without his leave and privity. God created Man, He beſt knows his ſtrength and ability, He has a clear proſpect of the moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and neceſſities, this ſublunary ſtate will expoſe him to. He fully underſtands, what time is fit to be ſpent in worldly buſineſs, and what in the concerns of Religion. Men have no certain rule, to determine by, for all People and Nations. If it had been left to them, the reſult of ſuch a conceſſion would have been nothing but ataxy and confuſion. Their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular imployments are very various, ſome are more incumbred than others. Some live in plenty and eaſe: ſome are expoſed to penury and ſevere labour. It cannot be expected, That they ſhall all agree about this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their condition is ſo different. God, who is only able to encreaſe ſupplies, and give more ſtrength, where more work is required, muſt neceſſarily be the moſt convenient Arbitrator in this caſe, to ſet out, how much time is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49823:191"/>to be allowed to Men for their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial affairs, and what proportion is to be reſerved for their celeſtial.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. This Time, which reaſon tells us, ought to be left to the Divine deſignation, is determined in the Fourth Command to one in Seven, as a proportion perpetually to be devoted to Religious Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Here Three Things are to be proved, 1. That it is one in Seven, and not the laſt of the Seven, which is enjoyned by the Fourth Command. 2. That the Sabbath of the Fourth Command, one in Seven, is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and not to continue, only during the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Oeconomy. 3. This proportion is by the Command to be devoted to Worſhip, and not only to corporal reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is one in Seven, and not the Seventh from the Creation, which is enjoyned by the Fourth Command. If we fully ponder the words, nothing elſe can be concluded from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy.</hi> It is not ſaid, Remember the Seventh day from the Creation: but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a day of reſt. All that the expreſſion ſignifies is, That a whole day muſt be ſet apart, and devoted to the honour of the Supreme Being. And leſt we ſhould be at a loſs, how often it muſt be done, the <hi>quotum</hi> is ſet out, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour, and do all that thou haſt to do, but the ſeventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> The Seventh, not the ſeventh from the Creation; but the Seventh with relation to the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49823:192"/>Six days of labour: and as the <hi>Six</hi> do not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thoſe preciſe days on which the World was made, but ſuch a proportion of time as is fit for the diſpatch of ſecular concerns: ſo the Seventh, which follows, muſt be taken in the ſame ſence, not for the Seventh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely from the formation of the World; but for one in ſeven, whether the firſt, or the laſt, as God ſhall pleaſe to appoint. Even as the fifth part of the encreaſe of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. <hi>v.</hi> 24. doth not ſignifie the Fifth in order, but the Fifth in proportion, that is one of five, the fruits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally divided into ſo many portions.</p>
               <p>After the proportion is thus ſet forth, the reaſon is expreſſed: <hi>For in ſix days the Lord made heaven and earth, and reſted the ſeventh.</hi> The force of this reaſon lies not in the priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or order of theſe days. <hi>God in the firſt ſix days created the World, and reſted the ſeventh;</hi> but in the <hi>quotum</hi> or number, God took ſix days, neither more nor leſs, for the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Univerſe, and reſted one: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt work ſix days, and obſerve one as a day of reſt unto the Lord. Thus the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betwixt the reaſon and the conceſſion of ſix days for labour is very plain. For if the World was created within ſix days, then the ſame allowance of time is ſufficient (with the Divine Benediction upon mens endeavours) to preſerve it, and make a proviſion of all things neceſſary for life This is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, if we lay the Emphaſis upon the firſt ſix days, and as they are taken, ſo muſt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49823:192"/>the Seventh be. So that altho' it was the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth priciſely from the creation on which God reſted, yet the Seventh here is not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſignifie that preciſe day: but the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and proportion of time only, which is contained in it. The rule of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the preſent caſe, <hi>propter illa,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The concluſion deduced from theſe premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, gives us a further evidence. <hi>Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</hi> Here is no mention of the ſeventh, but a Sabbath day, a general word which may be applied as well to the firſt, as the laſt of the week. This makes a clear diſcovery, That the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular day, on which God reſted is not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the reaſon of the Command. For if that had been the deſign of it, no place had been more convenient to expreſs it in, than the concluſion, which is nothing but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of what went before. In other places the Seventh is mentioned, but here only a Sabbath-day. Why the Spirit of God, who is not obnoxious to any defect of memory, ſhould change the phraſe, cannot be imagined, except he intended by uſing this general word, to give a greater latitude, and not to confine the Sabbath to the particular Seventh from the Creation.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be drawn from the words to diſcountenance this interpretation; <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>One in Seven was enjoyned long before. It bears the ſame date with the laſt of the Seven.

The Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is encompaſſed with Moral Laws, and placed in the very Centre of a perpetual rule of righteouſneſs.

                  </gap>, more valuable and eminent than others. Now if the obſervation of one in ſeven appertains to the Moral Law, and the laſt of the seven to the Ceremonial, we ought to interpret the Fourth command, for one in ſeven, and not the laſt: For the whole Decalogue being deſigned for a Royal Law, an everlaſting rule and ſtandard for all ages, certainly every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in it, is to be conſtrued in ſuch a ſence, as doth moſt fully comply with this intention in the Law-giver.</p>
               <p>This interpretation makes the fourth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept like to the others, it ſtands in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with, for they do not deſcend to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. The Firſt Command doth not name <hi>Saturn, Mars</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> but keeps in the general, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods.</hi> The Second doth not mention the image of any particular Deity. The Third doth not name aſſertory or promiſſory Oaths. The Fifth doth not nominate any individual, which ſtands in the relation of a Father or Mother. So the Fourth doth not expreſs the particular

The Command requires One day of every Week to be obſerved, as the Lord ſhall appoint. He appointed by another Law <hi>Saturday</hi> to be that One day during the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy, and when a period was put to that conſtitution, he did ſubſtitute the Firſt of the Week in the room of it.

There is no greater myſtery in the apprehending of this, than there is to underſtand how the Fifth Command, which did oblige the <hi>Jews</hi> to honour, <hi>Hezekias</hi> as thè Father of their Community, ſhould bind Chriſtians to pay the ſame reſpects to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>The Eighth Precept did forbid a <hi>Jew</hi> to invade the right of another; what was his right, the judicial Law did determine. Tho' that Law is at an end, and the rights of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49823:196"/>ſetled by the Laws of the Country where they live: yet the Eighth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth as much oblige them, as it did formerly the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I paſs to the Second branch of the Propoſition. The Sabbath of the Fourth Command, One in Seven is perpetual, and not to continue only during the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. This will be manifeſt if we conſider, it is part of the Decalogue, which is intended to oblige in all ages. 1. In the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is plainly diſtinguiſhed from thoſe Laws which the time of Reformation has put a period to. The Decalogue was publiſhed without a reſtriction to any particular place. The ceremonial and Judicial Laws are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:49823:196"/>Precepts, with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Nadab, &amp;c. v.</hi> 1. to import that the Decalogue muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved under the Goſpel, in times of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as well as <hi>Moſes.</hi> The other Precepts only du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron.</hi> An Ark was prepared for the preſerving of the Decalogue. No ſuch proviſion was made for the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law. The Ark where the Decalogue lay, was ſeparated for many years from the Tabernacle, where all the ceremonial ſervice was performed, and never joyned again to that which was of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s erection: but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> made a new Tent for it, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron</hi> 3.4.</note> and left the old in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> to ſhew that when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Tabernacle, with all the ceremonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions were laid aſide, and a more perfect Tabernacle erected by the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Ten Commandments would retain their force and vigour. He who will ſeriouſly conſider, what is upon record in the Old Teſtament, cannot but diſcern a very plain difference put betwixt the Ten Commandments, and thoſe Laws which were to be annulled in the time of the Goſpel. 2. In the New Teſtament, We have many evident intimations, That the Decalogue as delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as a perpetual rule to Chriſtians, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. By the Law we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Ten Commandments. Such a Law is ſpoken of, as is antecedent to the times of Chriſt, and this muſt be the Law of Nature, as publiſhed by the Light of Reaſon, or the Law as delivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi> The firſt cannot
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:49823:197"/>be here deſigned. For our Bleſſed Lord had that in his Eye, which the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> had a zeal for. They endeavoured to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Diſciples with a perſwaſion, That the intent of their Maſter was to deſtroy this Law, <hi>v.</hi> 17.20. The Law which was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their fervour, was nto the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it lies out of the Scripture, but the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> This Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not import one ſingle Precept, but a Syſtem or Combination, for that which is here called Law, is ſtiled Commandments, <hi>v.</hi> 19. There are but three Systems of Commands in the Pentateuch, The Ceremonial, The Judicial, and the Decalogue. The Two firſt cannot be underſtood, for the Law here is ſuch as none might break, and teach Men ſo to do. The words have an aſpect upon the future time, when the Kingdom of Heaven or the Goſpel-ſtate ſhould be more fully ſet up, which was not till the Pentecoſt, when the Apoſtles were anointed by the Spirit, and ſet upon their Thrones: but at that time it was lawful to act contrary to the judicial and ceremonial Syſteme, and teach others ſo to do. Therefore by the Law, nothing is left to be underſtood, but that Combination of Precepts, ſtiled, The Decalogue: and that we may know, it is That in every particular which is here eſtabliſhed, it is expreſſed, That one jot or tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from it, all ſhall continue in full vigour and power: and that we may have further aſſurance, That the Fourth Comandment, which is uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:49823:197"/>the leaſt, is in the number of the Precepts here ratified, it is added, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, &amp;c.</hi> to intimate, That not only the great, ſuch as are purely natural, and diſcoverable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out revelation, but the leſſer, ſuch as the Fourth Command is accounted to be, are here included.</p>
               <p>To the words of Chriſt, we may add the words of the Proto-Martyr, when he was about to Seal the Faith of the Goſpel with his blood. He aſſerts, That <hi>Moſes received the lively Oracles to give unto us, Act.</hi> 7.38. The lively Oracles are the Ten Commandments. They are ſtiled <hi>Oracles,</hi> becauſe they were laid up in the place from whence God uſed to give forth his Oracles: and <hi>lively</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the dead Oracles of the Heathens, which were obſerved to languiſh and fail about the time of the manifeſtation of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt: whereas the Ten Commandments were then in their full vigour. Theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <hi>Stephen,</hi> a ſincere Convert to the Faith of Chriſt, ſays, <hi>Moſes</hi> received, That he might deliver them to us. In this number, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes himſelf, as ſtanding in the relation of a Chriſtian, the whole Chapter being inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as an Apology for that profeſſion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Decalogue concerns us not only by virtue of the matter of it, but the Tradition and delivery by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this are very conſonant the words of S. <hi>Paul. Honour thy Father and thy Mother, which is the firſt Commandment with promiſe:
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49823:198"/>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayſt live long on the earth, Eph.</hi> 6.2, 3. This Promiſe is here mentioned with a deſign to quicken thoſe, who were Chriſtians and no <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by birth, to give a chearful obedience to the Fifth Command. The Apoſtle endeavours, That it may have this effect upon them, by declaring their particular intereſt in it. <hi>This is the firſt Commandment with promiſe,</hi> as well to you <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as thoſe who are <hi>Jews.</hi> If his meaning had been, That this is the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which was given with promiſe to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, therefore do you who are <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> conform to it, the ſtrength of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument had been loſt. It is no good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, That becauſe length of days was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the <hi>Jews,</hi> That therefore the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> ſhould enjoy the ſame priviledge. Many temporal bleſſings were entailed upon that people, which Chriſtians can make no juſt claim to. The Goſpel is a more refined di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation: under the Law there was leſs of the Spirit, and more of Temporal things. While Chriſtians are in the Sea of this world they cannot expect that the tide of external bleſſings ſhould be as great, as it was under the Judaical Oeconomy. Now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the whole Decalogue, which in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is more appropriated to the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> than this Promiſe. Thoſe words, <hi>That thy days may be long in the Land,</hi> ſeem to have a particular aſpect upon the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and if that in the Decalogue which ſeems to be moſt appropriated, is notwithſtanding not
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:49823:198"/>ſo, but common to Chriſtians, then that which ſeems to be leſs appropriated is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe common to them, and by conſequence the whole Decalogue. It is a known rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If that which has a greater appearance of being, is not, neither is that which has leſs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The words of S. <hi>James</hi> are of the ſame importance, <hi>For he that ſaid, do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill, c.</hi> 2.11. Theſe two Commands are perpetual, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all Chriſtians. The reaſon of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is not taken from their intrinſick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the authority of him who publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the time of <hi>Moſes.</hi> That that time and place is aimed at, is evident from <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture,</hi> that is, The Scripture and Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where the Law is laid down, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its being ſpoken by God upon the Mount related. This reaſon, whereby theſe Two Commands become obligatory under the Goſpel, extends to every particular precept in the Decalogue. <hi>He that ſaid, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not commit adultery, ſaid likewiſe, Remember the ſabbath day to keep it holy.</hi> All theſe were ſpoken at the ſame time, in the ſame manner, immediately by the mouth of God unto the People, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be affirmed of any of the Laws, which are not contained in that Combination. And if there be the ſame reaſon for the obligation of the whole Decalogue amongſt Chriſtians, as there is for the Sixth and Seventh Precepts,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:49823:199"/>then the whole doth oblige them, and will continue ſo to do to the World's End.</p>
               <p>Very conſonant to this is the Teſtimony of <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus,</hi> who, ſpeaking of theſe Two Laws, which S. <hi>James</hi> mentions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other parts of the Decalogue, which he ſtiles, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uſeth theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Moſes the ſervant of God was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of this divine Law to all the world.</hi> In this he aſſerts no more, than what the Apoſtle had done before him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>What things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them which are under the Law, that all the world may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God.</hi> By the World we muſt underſtand, not only <hi>Jews</hi> but <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as moſt evidently appears by the <hi>ninth verſe.</hi> It is impoſſible that the whole World ſhould be obnoxious to guilt, upon the account of diſobedience to the Moral Law, as it lyes in the Old Teſtament, had it not been intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally given to it. The Conſtitutions which go under the name of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi>

                  </note> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Decalogue, as a compleat and perfect Law appertaining to Chriſtians. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks of two ſorts of Divine Precepts,<note place="margin">L. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi> p. <hi>344.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularia,</hi> which are appropriated to the Old Teſtament, and <hi>eminentiora &amp; ſumma,</hi> which are common to the Old and New. The Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſt upon the place, reckons the Decalogue amongſt the laſt, it being deſigned by God, as a perpetual rule for his people in all ages. For this Gloſs he had authority enough from
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:49823:199"/>
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">L. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>39.</hi> c. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> who afterwards repreſents the Decalogue, as the Law of Nature, and at the coming of Chriſt to receive extenſion and enlargement, but no diſſolution.</p>
               <p>To theſe Teſtimonies, we may add the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of our own Church, which ſhe has ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcovered in her placing the Ten Commandments, as delivered in the <hi>Twentieth chap.</hi> of <hi>Exodus,</hi> in the very Catechiſm which Children are to learn, and obliging the people in the Liturgy, after the reading of every Precept, to uſe ſuch words as import, That it is a Law obligatory to them. To ſay, That She, by the word <hi>Law,</hi> underſtands ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Law only in the myſtical and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſence, is very incongruous: for ſhe makes no diſcrimination, but enjoyns the continuation of the ſame form of Speech to the laſt Command. A Precept without the Letter, is no Law at all. It is a known rule, That when the literal ſence of a Law is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, the whole Law is abrogated. For the Letter is the foundation, whatſoever is beſides, is the ſuperſtructure. The ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction muſt neceſſarily fall, when the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is removed. Tho' the ſpiritual ſence of a Law may be of uſe, when the Letter is diſcharged: yet it is not to be accounted as the ſence of that which is now a Law, but of that which was formerly ſo. The ſpiritual ſence of the Ceremonial Law is ſtill of uſe, yet becauſe the Literal is decayed and vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ſay the whole Law is annulled. The Law and the Letter of it always fall together.</p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:49823:200"/>
               <p>Therefore, If the Church had not believed every Law in the Decalogue, in the Letter to be binding to us, ſhe would not have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led every one of them a Law, in that known form, <hi>Lord, incline our hearts to keep this Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt all this it is objected,<note place="margin">Epilog. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>21.</hi> p. <hi>194.</hi>
                  </note> That the firſt and laſt Command of the Second Table, are by the terms of them appropriated to God's antient People. The Land of Promiſe in the Letter belongs to none but <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The Tenth Command forbiddeth <hi>to covet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man's wife,</hi> altho' adultery was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before; and therefore <hi>to covet onother man's wife,</hi> is to compaſs another man's wife, which might be done, where the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth divorces, as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law doth.</p>
               <p>To which I reply, 1. If theſe words, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the antient People of God, import no more than the being delivered with ſome accommodation to them, it is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe the firſt and laſt Precept in the ſecond Table, are thus appropriated, That therefore they concern no body elſe. The ritual Law was adapted to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thoſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vochim, p. <hi>46.</hi>
                  </note> which were in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the time when it was enacted. The Law whereby the eating of blood is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, was therefore given, becauſe the <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biiſts</hi> thought blood to be the food of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Gods, and conceived the way to contract an acquaintance with them, was to eat of it. The Law which forbiddeth the eating of the fruits of the firſt three years, was occaſioned
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:49823:200"/>by an Idolatrous cuſtome of the ſame People, who uſe to offer part of the Firſt-fruits of Trees to their Idol, and to eat the other part in their Idol-Temple, being poſſeſſed with an apprehenſion, That the Trees would wither and die, in caſe this cuſtome was intermitted. The preceptive part of the Writings of the Prophets, is plainly accommodated to the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Many parts of the New Teſtament are adapted to the condition of the Primitive times. S. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel was intended to affront the aſſertions of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles are proportioned to thoſe diſtempers, which ſome particular Churches conflicted with. The Sermons of Chriſt were preached to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Both his Sacraments are not without their peculiar aſpects. In Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm there is a ſpecial regard to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were no ſtrangers to the cuſtome of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Proſelytes by Water. Some rites in the Euchariſt were derived from their Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. Becauſe the Law had a particular aſpect upon the circumſtances of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> then living when it was firſt enacted, it is no good conſequence, That it was not obliging to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations, which were in a different condition: Or, Becauſe the Prophets were chiefly ſent to the <hi>Jews,</hi> That therefore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not concerned in the mandatory part of their Writings: Or, Becauſe the New Teſtament in the doctrinal and ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part of it, was calculated for a Meridian different from that which the Church is now
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49823:201"/>under; That therefore it does not oblige the Church in her preſent ſtate. We ſee the ſame art which is uſed in undermining the perpetuity of the Decalogue (ſhould it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail) would be as forcible againſt the Old and New Teſtament. <hi>Dominicus à Soto,</hi> who maintained the principle, did likewiſe own the conſequence, ſo far as it concerns the Old Teſtament.<note place="margin">Bellarm. de juſtif. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>930.</hi>
                  </note> He did aſſert, <hi>Nullum teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium ex libris Veteris Teſtamenti, quoad vim obligandi adduci poſſe Chriſtianis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thoſe words, <hi>appropriated to the ancient people of God,</hi> be taken ſtrictly, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from any thing which has been produced, that there is any ſuch appropriation of thoſe two Commands.</p>
               <p>The firſt runs in theſe terms, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother,</hi> This is the whole which appertains to the Precept properly taken; what is annexed, is a Promiſe, and not of the eſſence of the Mandatory part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue. Neither is the Promiſe ſo peculiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but that it may be applied unto others, which will be evident, if we conſider the words, <hi>That thy days may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Long life was not only the reward of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> but likewiſe the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

               <p>As for the laſt Command, I cannot find the leaſt appearance of an appropriation in it. The ſence of what the Epilogue aſſerts, muſt amount to this.</p>
               <p>Becauſe under the Law Divorce was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for that reaſon Men might be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to attempt the getting another man's wife from him, by ſuggeſting ſomething againſt her, which might occaſion a Bill of Divorce; therefore God enjoyned in the Tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, That no Man ſhould covet another's Wife.</p>
               <p>If this was ſo, How comes it to paſs that S. <hi>Paul</hi> repreſents this Command as in force among Chriſtians, who are not concerned in the Law of Divorce. Why is it ſaid not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbour's wife,</hi> but <hi>his maid-ſervant,</hi> which was never married, <hi>and his ox and his aſs?</hi> If the Law of Divorce was the only reaſon which did induce the ſupreme Legiſlator to give out this Law, it muſt neceſſarily follow, That a Man might give a Bill of Divorce not only to his Wife, but likewiſe to his Ox or his Aſs,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:49823:202"/>which ſuppoſeth him to be married to them.</p>

The mind being converſant about that which is evil, either it paſſeth thro' it without conſent, or elſe it is entertained with ſome unadviſed delight, or elſe it procures not only a ſudden delight, but a full and perfect conſent. In the firſt place, the mind doth not ſin, in the ſecond and third it doth, and this is that which is interdicted in the Tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, altho' Adultery is prohibited before. In the Precept concerning Adultery the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act is forbidden explicitly, the inward implicitely only. Now, becauſe of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which is in Men to believe, That the inward acts of the Soul are no further ſinful, but as they break out into external, it is the wiſdom of the ſupreme Law-giver in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of thoſe Laws which are intended as a perpetual rule of righteouſneſs, to annex one relating to theſe inward acts, on purpoſe to undeceive, and to leave us without the leaſt pretence, if we be not concerned in the reformation of them.</p>
               <p>All this being duly conſidered, it will be evident, That the Sabbath of the Fourth Command, One in Seven, is therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, becauſe it is a part of the Decalogue, which is deſigned to be a rule of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all ages.</p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:49823:202"/>
               <p>It is ſaid indeed, That this Precept cannot have the ſame priviledge with the reſt, to bind always. Becauſe, to all mankind it can import no more than a circumſtance of time, which is not of ſuch conſequence as to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a place amongſt the Moral Laws of God: Whereas to the <hi>Jews,</hi> it did import the Creation of all things, by the True God; and their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The maintaining the Morality of it gives a ſcandal to thoſe who have been ſeduced by it, to keep <hi>Saturday</hi> as their Sabbath.</p>
               <p>It is plainly a ceremonial Law, the Reſt of it was inſtituted to commemorate the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> ſervitude, and the deliverance from it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. We cannot be bound to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and not to the ſame meaſure of reſt which the Precept limiteth. It forbids not only ſervile work, ſuch as was prohibited on the firſt and laſt days of the Paſſeover: but all work, ſuch as kindling fire, dreſſing meat, which ought to be done on the Paſſeover-day. To all which I will reply in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mankind may be divided into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles. Gentiles</hi> are ſuch as are converted to the Chriſtian Faith, or not converted. Thoſe who are, be the perſons here concerned. Whatſoever did make the Fourth Command a matter of moment to the <hi>Jews,</hi> will make it of the like importance to them. As for the Creation of the World by the True God, they are every jot as much concerned in it, and do as ſincerely believe it, as the <hi>Jews.</hi> As for the deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:49823:203"/>That they are accounted as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed, ingrafted into the ſame ſtock with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and become one people with them, the partition-wall being taken down by Chriſt, it will follow, if the <hi>Jews</hi> were concerned in that mercy, the converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> muſt be ſo too. Tho' they were aliens formerly, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a naturalization is paſſed upon them, their concernments are the ſame with thoſe who were born ſubjects. The Chriſtian Church is divided into Twelve Tribes,<note place="margin">Dial. cum Tryph. p. <hi>353.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The maintaining of the morality of the Fourth Precept, gives no ſcandal. If there be any in the caſe, it is taken and not given: What if they who keep <hi>Saturday</hi> for their Sabbath, ground their practice upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of it? Muſt we believe the ground is not good, becauſe that which is built upon it by ſuch perſons is bad? An infirm houſe may ſtand upon a good ſoil. Had the Apoſtle any reaſon to diſlike his foundation, becauſe ſome did build <hi>wood, hay and ſtubble</hi> upon it? If any ſcandal be given, upon inquiry it will
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:49823:203"/>be found that the contrary doctrin doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it in far greater meaſures. Thoſe who defend the Morality of the Command, deny <hi>Saturday</hi> to be contained in it. Their reaſons I have already laid down. The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue which denies the Morality, aſſerts that <hi>Saturday</hi> is expreſly contained in it. Now when thoſe who are inclined to keep <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> as a Sabbath, find it granted to their hand, That that very day is enjoyned by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; and then conſider, That this very Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is placed in the very heart of thoſe Laws which were immediately given by God, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon Tables of Stone, preſerved in the Ark, confirmed by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Bellar. l. <hi>4.</hi> de juſt. c. <hi>6.</hi> p. <hi>930.</hi>
                  </note> and commended by the Apoſtles, received by the Church, and inſerted into her Liturgy and Catechiſm. It is more than an even wager, That they will inſtantly fall upon the obſerving <hi>Saturday</hi> as their Sabbath. It had been good, That the contriver of this objection had conſidered the words of <hi>Origen,</hi> before he had ſo deeply charged his adverſary,<note place="margin">L. <hi>6.</hi> cont. Cel. p. <hi>313.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a very great fault in diſputing, if any accuſe others of opinions as unſound, when their own Sentiments are chargeable with the ſame crime.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Fourth Command is no ceremonial Law. I willingly grant, That the Jewiſh day was Typical: but no ſuch thing appears concerning the Sabbath enjoyned by this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. The reaſon taken from the bondage of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and their deliverance from it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. doth not demonſtrate
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:49823:204"/>any ſuch thing. All that can be concluded from thence, is, That the reſt required is a commemoration of that condition, and their being taken out of it. The thing commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated being paſt, and a ceremony, a ſhadow of a thing to come: The reſt of the Fourth Precept cannot be ceremonial upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. If it be ſaid, That the deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was Typical, and therefore the reſt, deſigned to commemorate it, muſt be ſo too. I anſwer, That bleſſings may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a twofold reſpect, either as a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which was paſt, or as a ſhadow of that which was to come. The reſt commanded was to commemorate the deliverance in the firſt ſence. For the Law being given to all, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the end of the reſt was to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the benefit which was obvious to all, and not the ſhadow which was underſtood by few or none in compariſon at that time. Now this deliverance, as a real mercy, being of concernment to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> after their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtock, I cannot ſee how the command is in danger of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged upon the account of its relation to this favour. Upon the ſame ground we may ſay, That the whole Decalogue is annulled becauſe this kindneſs is expreſſed in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of it, as a motive to Obedience. The reaſons of the Fourth Command are either Primary or Secondary. The Primary is, That God may have a fit time for his Solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The Secondary, are to commemorate the Creation and deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:49823:204"/>The firſt is eſſential to it, and cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from it. The ſecondary are extrinſecal and ſeparable; and therefore the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is ſaid to be repeated, [<hi>Theſe words the Lord ſpake, and added no more, Deut.</hi> 5.22.] Altho' the reaſon taken from the Creation of the World, <hi>Exo.</hi> 20. is totally omitted. If the abſence of this reaſon makes no alteration upon the Precept, but the whole Law is ſaid to be ſpoken, altho it be wanting: then the preſence of a new reaſon taken from the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſervitude, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have any influence upon it, either to make it Ceremonial or Moral. The ſecondary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a Ceremonial Command, may be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and of a Moral, Ceremonial and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. It is to be obſerved, That the reaſon we ſpeak of, has relation but to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the Command, namely, the enjoyning of Maſters to make the Sabbath a day of reſt unto their Servants, as well as to themſelves. Now to make the whole Command Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, upon the account of an extrinſecal and ſecondary reaſon, relating only to one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in it, I leave it to every unbiaſſed mind to determine, whether it be agreeable to the uſual rules of diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is no inconvenience which will follow, if we aſſert, That as we are bound to the Fourth Command, ſo likewiſe to the ſame meaſure of reſt, which that Precept li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth. A reſt only in general is required, and that in order to the keeping of One Day in a Week Holy. This being the end, and the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:49823:205"/>end always modifying the means, we have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, That ſuch a meaſure of reſt is only underſtood as has a tendency to promote this purpoſe. All who believe the Lord's day to be grounded upon Apoſtolical authority muſt neceſſarily grant, that we are bound to reſt upon it from all thoſe works, which are not reconcileable with the end of the inſtitution, namely, The devoting of the whole day to the honour and worſhip of Chriſt. If there be any ſtricter meaſures of reſt, enjoyned upon the particular Seventh from the Creation, by any other Law, it nothing concerns us, no more than the day it ſelf. It is not true, That the Fourth Command doth forbid all work whatſoever. For if this was the ſence of it, it would be repugnant to the Law of Nature, which requires, <hi>That works of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, piety and mercy be done at all times.</hi> There was a Law amongſt the Heathens, That no work ſhould be done on their feaſt days, when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbro</hi> and <hi>Scaevola</hi> were conſulted about the meaning of it, they, notwithſtanding the ſtrictneſs of the words, made anſwer, That ſuch work might be done which did relate <hi>ad Deos, ad urgentem vitae utilitatem, quod praetermiſſum noceret.</hi> What kind of work the Fourth Command prohibits, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the words of it: <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work, but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not do any work,</hi> that is, any which appertains to thy particular calling or functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which might with equal advantage have
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49823:205"/>been diſpatched in the week time. Therefore when ſervile work is expreſly forbidden on the Paſſeover. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and dreſſing of meat allowed; but on the Sabbath, in the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all work: <hi>all work</hi> imports no more than ſervile.

               <p>It cannot in reaſon be thought, That the Fourth Command prohibits the dreſſing of meat, or kindling of fire on the Sabbath, which ſpeaks nothing of theſe particulars: When as thoſe particular Laws which carry a much fairer and more probable appearance of ſuch an interdiction, upon an exact inquiry, will be found to import no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>As for the dreſſing of meat, the words uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alledged are theſe. <hi>To morrow is the reſt of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord, bake that which will bake to day, and ſeethe that which will ſeethe, and that which remaineth, lay up for you to be kept until the morning, Exod.</hi> 16.23. This Text ſpeaks of the <hi>Manna,</hi> of which a double portion did deſcend from Heaven on the day preceding the Sabbath. Of this portion, one they might bake and ſeethe and eat that day, the other part they were to lay up unbak'd and unſodden. <hi>Bake that which you will bake, and ſeethe that which you will ſeethe, and that which remaineth,</hi> not of what was baked or ſodden, but of what was gathered over and above the daily proportion, <hi>That lay up to be kept till the morning.</hi> This is plain from the miracle expreſſed in the next verſe. <hi>They laid it up till the morning, and it did not ſtink, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any worm in it.</hi> If it had not been raw, the glory of the miracle had been celypſed. Before they reſerved ſome, which they had gathered contrary to God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49823:206"/>and it was putrified in the morning; and now they reſerve a portion according to his Command, and no putrefaction is in it. If it had been baked or ſodden, it would have been thought, That that was the reaſon, why it was not corrupted as before. Indeed in the fifth <hi>ver.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>On the ſixth day they ſhall prepare that which they ſhall bring in,</hi> that is, If any have a mind not to eat it raw, but to prepare it for food, whether by grinding it in Mills, beating it in a Mortar,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 11.8.</note> or any other toilſome way, all ſuch elaborate preparations muſt be finiſhed upon the Sixth day, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining too much ſervile work for a Sabbath. Yet notwithſtanding all this, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Text, but that upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath they might do in order to a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preparation of it, what Chriſtians uſually do about their food on the Lord's day.</p>
               <p>As for the kindling of fire, it is manifeſt, That the Text commonly alledged, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.3. muſt undergo ſome reſtriction, for the Prieſts were bound to bake the Shew-bread, and ſet it hot upon the Table every Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.5, 8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.6. And to offer up the Sacrifice of the Sabbath, which could not be done without the kindling of fire. Altho' the fire which came down from heaven, was conſtantly upon the Altar, and ſo continued till it came <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> into the houſe of eternity or Temple, where it was renewed: yet it is plain, That it was daily maintained by a ſupply of new fewel. <hi>The Prieſt was to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:49823:207"/>lay wood every morning on it, Lev.</hi> 6.12. And ſo ſoon as the old fire had disjoyned the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and put them into motion, new fire muſt neceſſarily be kindled. This is taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by <hi>Munſter</hi> upon the Text, <hi>Judaei hoc praeceptum, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> think this Precept is to be obſerved in the Letter, and therefore they hire Chriſtians to kindle their fire on the Sabbath, not conſidering it was lawful for the Prieſts to make a fire on the Sabbath, for the daily Sacrifice. All this doth manifeſt that the Text, which is under conſideration, muſt not be taken in that latitude, which it ſeems to have at the firſt view: and if it muſt have ſome limitation, it cannot be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained than to what is expreſſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. The thing treated of is the work of the Tabernacle, tho' many cautions had been given concerning the forbearance of ſervile work on the Sabbath, upon any private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: yet ſome might be apt to think, That work tending to the preparing of materials for the compoſing that Sacred Tent was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For the prevention of ſuch thoughts, before the deſcription of what was requiſite is entered upon, this Precept is laid down, That in order to any ſuch work, whether the melting of Silver, Gold, or any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which might be neceſſary about the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, not ſo much as a fire ſhould be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>And now I have finiſhed the ſecond branch of the Propoſition, That the Sabbath of the Fourth Command One in Seven is perpetual,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:49823:207"/>and not to continue only during the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy.</p>
               <p>I will proceed to the Third. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion One in Seven is by the Command to be devoted to Divine Worſhip, and not only to corporal reſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides Bodily reſt, there is mention like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of a Sanctification of the Sabbath, as a thing diſtinct from it. Sanctification is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as the end, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</hi> The reſt as a means to advance this work, <hi>In it thou ſhalt do no work,</hi> Corporal labour being an impediment to the exerciſe of Religion. If the end and the means are always diſtinct, then Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation muſt import ſomething different from the reſt of the day, and this can be nothing but the devoting of it to the Solemn Worſhip of God. This we may collect, firſt, From the order of the Commands, in the <hi>Firſt</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, who we muſt Worſhip. <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me:</hi> In the <hi>Second,</hi> How we muſt not Worſhip him, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make any graven image of him:</hi> In the <hi>Third,</hi> How we muſt, with holy reverence, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain:</hi> In the <hi>Fourth,</hi> We have the ſolemn time when this Service muſt be performed, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath to ſanctifie,</hi> or ſet it a-part for this Sacred Work. Upon the account of the relation which this Command has to the other Three Precepts of the firſt Table, The keeping of it is put for the obſervation of them all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.2. And the <hi>Jews</hi> have a
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:49823:208"/>ſaying, That the Sabbath is equivalent to all Commands. Secondly. The Bleſſing of the Sabbath. <hi>God bleſſed the Sabbath-day.</hi> Here is ſomething contained in theſe words, which imports a ſpecial benediction. It is no ſuch Emphatical Bleſſing for a day to be devoted meerly to idleneſs. That day is moſt bleſſed, on which God is moſt honoured. But God has more honour by the honeſt actions of Men in thoſe vocations in which he has placed them, than he can have by meer ſloth, and a total ceſſation from labour, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Sacred Worſhip. Thirdly, The practice of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon the Sabbath, They had a holy Convocation, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Preaching out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16, 17.

                  <q>That the only thing commanded by the Letter of the Fourth Command is <hi>to reſt from bodily labour upon the ſeventh day of the week, in which God reſted,</hi> from whence it is called a <hi>Sabbath.</hi>

               <p>The grounds of this perſwaſion are theſe, The Precept extends to Cattle, which are in no capacity to do any thing appertaining to a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but reſt from their labour: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſtrangers, that is, ſuch as were not circumciſed, but Converts from Idols, and Proſelytes of the Gate. As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were bound to ſee their Cattle they did not work, ſo likewiſe to theſe ſtrangers: They of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:49823:209"/>themſelves were under no obligation, being tyed only to the Seven Precepts which the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> received from him, of which number the Sabbath was none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To keep holy the Sabbath,</hi> ſignifies only to ſit ſtill on the Seventh day. There is as much holineſs in this, as in offering a brute beaſt unto God, being ſtamped with a divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Reſt of the Body, ſignifying the Reſt of the Soul from ſin, as the Sacrifice did the holineſs of Chriſt. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what is aſſerted by the learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Epilogue. To which I reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is no good conſequence, becauſe the Precept extends to Cattle, which are in no capacity to do any thing appertaining to the Sabbath, but only ceaſe from bodily labour; That therefore nothing but bodily reſt is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in it. The Decree of the King of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh</hi> concerning the Faſt did reach to Cattle; yet it is not true, That nothing was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Inhabitants of the City, but what might be performed by Cattle. We muſt take notice, That a part only of the Command extends to Cattle. It is required of the Maſters of them, That they ſhall not be imployed in that uſual work they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for in the week-time: but not that they keep holy the Sabbath-day. To aſſert, That Cattle are concerned in the whole Precept, becauſe they are in one part, is as if we ſhould affirm, That <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſons Cattle had all <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> for their paſture, becauſe they had <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen</hi> which was a part of it.</p>

               <p>As for Strangers they were capable both of reſting and ſanctifying the Sabbath. If we ſuppoſe they were tyed only to the Seven Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> how doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That the Sabbath of the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was not contained under one of them?

               <p>If the Sabbath was none of them, yet it muſt be remembred, That the Tye was made not by a divine, but a humane appointment.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Precepts materially conſidered are in the Scripture: yet they are not in that form and order in which they are delivered by the <hi>Talmudiſts:</hi> Nor is there any intimation given, that it was the Will of God, That Proſelytes or Converts from Idols ſhould be obliged to theſe and no other. I doubt not but this was a decree of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and that it might have the greater reverence
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:49823:210"/>paid to it, the Rabbins generally aſcribe it to God. If Proſelytes or ſtrangers were tied only to theſe Seven Precepts by the will of Men: yet they might be obliged to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of others, in particular the Sabbath of the Fourth Command by the Will of God. <hi>A Stranger for the ſin of ignorance was bound to offer up a ſhe-goat of the firſt year, Num.</hi> 15.27, 29. which injunction is no part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Precepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah.</hi>

Beſides the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive holineſs, there is ſomething diſcernable in a Sacrifice, which is not to be found in ſuch a ſlothful poſture. <hi>The earth being the Lord's,</hi> and he granting the uſe of it to Men, for a ſupply of their neceſſities, the giving back ſome part of it by way of oblation, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a piece of Homage, and an expreſſion of their agnitions of his Soveraignty over the whole.<note place="margin">Judith <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7.

All this cannot be aſſerted of ſitting ſtill, which gives nothing to God, but implies the withholding and ſuppreſſion of thoſe actions, whereby the Body is in any
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:49823:210"/>capacity to honour him. If there had been nothing in Sacrifice but a figurative holineſs, no account can be given why it ſhould meet with ſo general and ready entertainment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens who were ſtrangers to the figure. <hi>Porphyry,</hi>

                  </gap>. The Inhabitants of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> are no ſooner poſſeſſed with a belief of the divinity of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but they make an attempt to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice Oxen to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.13. Whereas ſitting ſtill could never gain the leaſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation among them. The <hi>Jews</hi> who were grown into a very ſuperſtitious practice in this particular were rather made the object of their deriſion. They repreſent them as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſpent the Seventh part of their time in idleneſs. Tho' I am far from believing, That the oblation of material things unto God, accompanied with a deſtruction of them, is warranted by the Law of Nature; as I have expreſſed in the firſt <hi>Section:</hi> Yet it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from what has been ſpoken, That more reaſon may be alledged in ſavour of it, than for ſitting ſtill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sitting ſtill on the Seventh day was never ſtamped with the authority of Heaven. If this was the meaning of the Fourth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, then God repeated it, ſo ſoon as it was enacted by him in theſe particular Laws, in which he appointed, That upon the Sabbath there ſhould be a holy Convocation, and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49823:211"/>the offering up of Sacrifice. The People could not convene nor the Prieſts Sacrifice without bodily motion. When it is ſaid, <hi>Let no man go out of his place on the Seventh day:</hi>

                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29.</note> It muſt be underſtood with relation to the gathering of <hi>Manna,</hi> and the doing ſuch unneceſſary work as might have been diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the week-time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It doth not appear, That the Reſt of the Body enjoyned in the Fourth Command, is deſigned as a figure to ſignifie the Reſt of the Soul from ſin. There is no Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which imports any ſuch matter. And if fancy be permitted to make Types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures as it pleaſeth, where there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from Heaven to ſteer our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by, there will be no end of them: a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure being the effect of a poſitive inſtitution cannot be diſcovered without the knowledge of the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>If the Reſt of the Body is a Type of the Reſt of the Soul from ſin, then it ſignifies Reſt from ſome, or from all ſins. Not from ſome only. The Bible gives no intimation of any particular delinquency, which the Reſt of the Sabbath of the Fourth Command typifies our ceſſation from. Not from all. For betwixt the Type and the thing ſignified, there ought to be ſome reſemblance which is not diſcernable betwixt the Souls Reſt from ſome enormities, and the Reſt of the Body. The Soul then reſts from ſins of omiſſion, when it is converſant about the diſcharge of thoſe duties which are devolved upon it.
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:49823:211"/>This kind of Spiritual Reſt conſiſts in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Reſt of the Body bears no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to the operations of the Soul.</p>
               <p>Now I have finiſhed the Seventh Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſolemn Time for Worſhip, which ought to be no leſs than One Day every Week; determined in the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to One in Seven, as a proportion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be devoted to Divine Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. This proportion One in Seven was determined to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day by another Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which was to oblige only, till the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Oeconomy had a period put to it.</p>
               <p>Here are Two things to be evinced, 1. That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath was ſet out by a Law di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Fourth Command. 2. That this Law was to continue no longer than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy.</p>

                  </gap> which can import no leſs than ſome difference, and diſtinction betwixt the Two Laws. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the duplication may be this. The <hi>Jews</hi> being under a twofold Command, the Law concerning the particular Day, and the Law touching the Proportion: They had a double Sabbath, namely, the laſt of the Week, and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49823:212"/>the Sabbath of the Fourth Command which is One Day in a Week. The Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand enjoyning only <hi>vagum quid,</hi> One in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and this <hi>vagum</hi> taking up its reſt for a time in the particular <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day, That day is ſtiled <hi>Sabbatum Sabbati,</hi> the reſt of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Fourth Command. The calling afterwards the Tenth Day of the Seventh Month, and the Seventh Year of releaſe by the ſame name doth not weaken this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The name is firſt given to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> weekly Sabbath upon the grounds expreſſed, and then afterwards applyed unto thoſe times to ſignifie, That the <hi>Jews</hi> ought to make the Reſt of the Sabbath, the pattern of their Reſt on thoſe Solemnities, and therefore when the day of expiation is ſo ſtiled, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32. in the LXX. theſe words occur <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, You ſhall ſabbatize or imitate, in the obſervation of this yearly ſolemnity, the Reſt of the weekly Sabbath. When the year of releaſe is ſo named, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. The Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latin plainly points at this imitation, <hi>Sabbatizes Sabbatum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Law is likewiſe mentioned, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.13, 14. In the Thirteenth verſe, We have an account of the whole Decalogue, under theſe names, <hi>Right judgments, true laws, good ſtatutes and commandments.</hi> That by theſe we are to underſtand the Ten Commandments and nothing elſe, is clear, in that it is ſaid, That God himſelf gave them from Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> God gave there immediately by himſelf the whole Decalogue and no other Laws.
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:49823:212"/>After the Ten Commandments are thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, of which number the Fourth is one: it is ſaid in the next Verſe, <hi>And thou madeſt known unto them thy holy Sabbath, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandedſt them precepts, and ſtatutes and laws, by the hand of Moſes thy ſervant.</hi> Here the particular <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day is expreſſed as a thing diſtinct from the Sabbath of the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and reckoned amongſt the Precepts, Statutes and Laws which were given by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Therefore there muſt be ſome diſtinction betwixt the Sabbath as it lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ten Commandments, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day.</p>

                  <hi>Maimonides</hi> intimates, That there was a Sabbath given to them in particular, and a Sabbath likewiſe given to all: the ſcope of which was, That the Seventh part of the life of a Man might be free of toil, and dedicated to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Creation. In the Six Hundred and Thirteen Precepts commonly reputed by the Rabbins to have been given to <hi>Moſes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the Sabbath according to the collection of <hi>Abraham Ben Kattani</hi> as it lies in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8. makes the Twenty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth: as it lies in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.12. makes the Seventy Ninth.

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:49823:213"/>of <hi>Exod.</hi> is undoubtedly the laſt of the week, therefore the Sabbath in the Twentieth muſt be ſomething elſe.

               <p n="2">2. This Law concerning the particular day, on which the <hi>Jews</hi> reſted, was to continue no longer than the Jewiſh Oeconomy.</p>
               <p>The day of the reſurrection of our Bleſſed Lord put a period to it.

Tho' the Diſciples had obſerved many of the Jewiſh Sabbaths before: yet this expreſſion, <hi>according to command,</hi> is never uſed till now, which intimates, That there muſt be ſome ſpecial reaſon for it: and what can this be but only to ſhew how far the Diſciples might go in the celebration of the old day according to Precept, namely, to the Reſurrection of Chriſt? If they went any further, it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out command, That being deſigned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue no longer.

After this

                  </gap> has an indefinite ſound: yet the Apoſtle doth not intend that it ſhould ſignifie any day, and by conſequence include the Lord's day. As his repreſenting meats and drinks to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. doth not depretiate the Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper, and ſink them into an equality with our common bread and drink: ſo neither doth his putting days upon the ſame level, make all days of the ſame rank with the Lord's day.

That which occaſioned the Apoſtle to write thus, were the different opinions among thoſe who were converted to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. He, who was formerly a <hi>Jew</hi> had an eſteem for the old Sabbath-Paſſeover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above other days. The Converted <hi>Gentile</hi>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:49823:214"/>had an equal regard for them.

If this day in the Apoſtle's appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion had not been equal with others, no account can be given, why he, that did not regard it, is ſo gently treated; and not rather ſharply reproved for his contempt. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why he who had a reſpect for it, is ſo tenderly handled, is becauſe he was brought up under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy, and it could not be expected, that he ſhould in an inſtant be diſingaged from thoſe impreſſions which his education had made upon him. The Apoſtle was glad, That he had entertained the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtian Religion, and uſed all the tenderneſs imaginable towards him, that he might invite him into a more intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it.

               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:49823:216"/>
               <p>That which lies againſt this conjecture, is, That the <hi>Miſhna</hi> was not ſo early as S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles; and therefore he could not have any reſpect to the Sections in it. To which I reply, that <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us, That the Head of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> had a private Copy of the Traditions, as they were delivered from the mouth of thoſe, who were Doctors in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> long before the times of Rabbi <hi>Jehuda,</hi> the compiler of the <hi>Miſhna,</hi> and the Author of <hi>Halicoth Olam;</hi> That the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for memory ſake, wrote the Oral Law in Characters. The Book written by them they might not divulge, and therefore called it the Book of Secrets. S. <hi>Paul</hi> being trained up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and in the deepeſt myſteries of their Religion, no doubt had the peruſal of it, and might very well have an eye upon the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Sections of it, in the words which are under debate. That which Rabbi <hi>Jehuda</hi> did, was to joyn together what lay ſcattered in private hands, and to make a publication of it in one entire Volume.</p>
               <p>There is no juſt cauſe of fear, leſt from this Text, the Sabbath of the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſhould receive any prejudice. Clear evidence has been already produced for the Morality of it: Whereas the Sabbath here is repreſented to be of a figurative nature. The Fourth Command enjoyns only a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervation of One in Seven every week. If the Apoſtle had condemned this, he had condemned himſelf, and the whole Chriſtian Church, which did devote the Firſt of the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:49823:217"/>Week, which is One Day in Seven, to the Honour and Worſhip of the Supreme Being.</p>
               <p>And now I have done with the Eighth Propoſition. The Proportion, One in Seven ſet out by the Fourth Command, was determined to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day by another Precept, which was to continue no longer than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oeconomy.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. When the laſt of the Week had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod put unto it, The Firſt was ſubſtituted in the room of it.</p>
               <p>This Subſtitution is favoured by the Law, Prophets, our Bleſſed Lord, the Holy Apoſtles, the Teſtimony of the following Ages.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Law, The Hebdomadal obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's day aſſures us, That the Primitive Chriſtians had their Eye upon the Law in the keeping of it. This Weekly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which univerſally prevailed, could proceed from nothing but a ſence of ſome rule which they were all acquainted with. They might have celebrated it once a Fortnight, or once a Month, or once a Year; as Eaſter is, had they been left to their own conduct. Their general agreement in a weekly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation doth evidently argue a reſpect, which they had, to the proportion of time ſet out by the Law under the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>And if they had their Eye upon it, they could not but diſcern, what is literally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, and act in a conformity to it.</p>
               <p>The old Sabbath being abrogated, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Fourth Precept declares, That the Firſt of the Week muſt come into the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:49823:217"/>place of it. For in it is required one day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, for Divine Worſhip, Six for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular concernments: and that the Six days come all together. <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour,</hi> not one or two, and then reſt; but upon Six days together, according to the example of God himſelf, who in the ſpace of ſix days without any interruption did create the World. Theſe two things being granted, which the very words of the Command will extort from us, the determination of One in Seven to a particular Day, muſt neceſſarily fall upon the Firſt of the Week. For if upon any other, as the Second, Third, Fourth or Fifth following the abolition of the old day, then the ſix days for Secular imployment could not come together. If the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was deferred till the ſecond week following the abrogation, then a whole week was paſt without any Sabbath, contrary to the plain ſence of the Precept, which requires One Day every Week to be perpetually obſerved as a Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prophets, They repreſent the Firſt of the Week either expreſly under the notion of a Sabbath, or elſe in ſuch terms, as are equivalent. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holineſs: from the womb of the morning thou haſt the dew of thy youth, Pſ.</hi> 110.3.

In the raiſing Chriſt from the dead, was put forth the exceeding greatneſs of his power, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the might of his ſtrength, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. When he was raiſed, <hi>All power was given to him, both in heaven and earth, Mat.</hi> 28.18. Tho' theſe words were not ſpoken upon the Reſurrection-day, yet the power mentioned in them was then conferred. At the concluſion of that day we read of the effects of it, in giving a Commiſſion to the Diſciples <hi>To teach all nations; and preach the Goſpel to every creature, Mark:</hi> 16.15. It is not ſtrange that the day of Solemn Worſhip ſhould be ſtiled a day of Power and Strength.

On the Firſt Day was the Feaſt of Trumpets, on the Tenth the Feaſt of Expiation, on the Fifteenth the Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, on the Three and Twentieth <hi>Feſtum retentionis.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> did account their Sabbath as a day of Power. They ſay Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was deferred to the Eighth day, That the Child might have the advantage of a Sabbath, to ſtrengthen it againſt that Time.</p>
               <p>As the Title, ſo the action appropriated to this day, argues it to be the Firſt of the Week, namely, <hi>The generation of the Son of God.</hi> It is ſaid of the Reſurrection-day, <hi>This day have I begotten thee, Acts</hi> 13.33. Then was he declared to be <hi>The Son of God with power, Rom.</hi> 1.3. The ſame thing in a Poetical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is affirmed to be done upon the Morning of this day of Power. <hi>From the womb of the morning, thou haſt the dew of thy Youth.</hi> This Morning muſt be related to ſome day, and to what day better than the day of Power.

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:49823:219"/>are compelled to it from ſome other Text. Other Scriptures are ſo far from putting this neceſſity upon us, That they conſpire to caſt a favourable aſpect upon the interpretation which is given.</p>

This is the Day which the Lord hath made, not by Creation, ſo he has made every day, but by a ſpecial Inſtitution. Here is the end for which it is made, That we may joy and be glad in it. The Worſhip of God is always to be performed with Spiritual rejoycing at this time for the Mercies of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

                  </note> The ancient Church did never appoint a Faſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord's-day, mourning being not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the reaſon of its Inſtitution. Laſtly, Here is the place where this day is to be obſerved, the Sanctuary, <hi>Open to me the gates of righteouſneſs, into which the righteous ſhall enter, v.</hi> 19, 20. The gates of righteouſneſs import, as under the Law the doors of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, Temple, Synagogue; ſo under the Goſpel the doors of Churches into which the Righteous are to enter upon the Firſt of the Week to Worſhip God, and expreſs their
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:49823:219"/>grateful acknowledgments of the love of Chriſt in the work of Redemption.</p>
               <p>To this we may add the prediction of <hi>Iſaiah.

He promiſeth Miniſters to inſtruct this People under the name of <hi>Prieſts and Levites, v.</hi> 21. Evangelical Ordinances under the name of <hi>new heavens and new earth, v.</hi> 22. The time is foretold when this People are to attend upon theſe Ordinances, <hi>From one new moon unto another, and from one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to another.</hi> As there will be Feſtivals confined to certain months: So likewiſe a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day every week under the Goſpel, when all fleſh ſhall come to Worſhip. What can this be but the Lord's day, which all Chriſtians, whether formerly <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did devote to the acts of Religious Veneration. If the words may be read as they are in the Margin of our Bibles; from Sabbath to his Sabbath, which is very agreeable to the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a great advantage will accrue to the Cauſe we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For as the People here ſpoken of are the People of Chriſt; the Miniſters, the Miniſters of Chriſt; the Ordinances, the Ordinances of Chriſt: So by his Sabbath, we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Sabbath of Chriſt.

               <p n="3">3. Our Bleſſed Lord. <hi>For the Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath day, Matt.</hi> 12.8. Our Saviour here aſſumes unto himſelf a title of Power, He calls himſelf <hi>Lord of the Sabbath.</hi> This power was communicated unto him, He had it as he was <hi>Son of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Communication was not made without a deſign, and ſome ponderous reaſon. The only deſign viſible to us, is, That he might make ſome alteration about the Sabbath. He is ſaid, not only to be Lord, but Lord <hi>even</hi> or <hi>alſo,</hi> which imports, That he has a power over ſomething elſe in this place, beſides the Sabbath; and that his power over the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is to the ſame purpoſe with that power over thoſe things whatſoever they be. The things mentioned in the former Verſes, are the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which he put a period to, and did erect other conſtitutions in the room of them. We have already proved, That the old day is annulled by him. The Firſt of the Week is ſtiled the Lord's day: what can <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be, but an effect of that power, which the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pray, That your flight be not on the Sabbath-day, Mat.</hi> 24.20. It appears from hence, That a Sabbath would be obſerved about Forty Years after theſe words were ſpoken: for the flight mentioned in them was upon the account of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, ſtiled, <hi>the abomination of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:49823:220"/>which about that time beſieged, and took <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called <hi>the holy place.</hi> It is not ſaid, Pray that you be not put upon this extremity <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a general word which may be applyed to the firſt as well as the laſt of the Week. This Sabbath is to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Diſciples, for he treats them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and we cannot think he would uſe ſuch an emphatical expreſſion, which has a tendency to beget an awful regard to the Sabbath here mentioned, in caſe they had not been concerned in the obſervation of it: about the time which Chriſt had his Eye upon, no other Sabbath was obſerved by the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but the Firſt of the Week. About Two and Twenty Years after his Death, we find it kept in a very full Aſſembly, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. After which there is not the leaſt mention of the celebration of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> day in the New Teſtament: but on the contrary, S. <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the obſervation of it, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.16. This Epiſtle was written not long before his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, when he was in his bonds at <hi>Rome, c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 18. Therefore we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That our Bleſſed Saviour had his Eye upon the Firſt of the Week, when he exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Diſciples to pray, <hi>That their flight might not be on the Sabbath day.</hi> As a Winter-flight would have been prejudicial to their bodies: So likewiſe to fly upon the Sabbath, when they were to be ingaged in the moſt ſolemn addreſſes to the Divine Majeſty, would be really diſadvantageous to their Souls.</p>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:49823:221"/>
               <p>Indeed it is pretended, That our Saviour's words were occaſioned, either by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of ſome trouble to the Diſciples from the ſuperſtitious <hi>Jews,</hi> who would certainly hinder them in their flight upon their Sabbath: or elſe of ſome moleſtation in their own Conſciences, ariſing from their being not fully weaned from the obſervation of the Ceremonial Rites. To which I reply, That no ſuch thing could in reaſon be feared, as the being hindred by the <hi>Jews;</hi> becauſe, before the time which is ſpoken of, they had laid aſide their Superſtitious conceits about ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſtill, or the going only a Sabbath-days journey, when they were in capital dangers, and received it as a Maxim,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> That when life is expoſed to hazard, the reſt of the Sabbath may be diſpenſed with. Tho' the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubmit to this rule, yet they being a very inconſiderable party in reſpect of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and without any power of inflicting penalties, they could be no impediment to the Chriſtians in their flight. As for the trouble ariſing from their own Conſciences, That cannot be ſuppoſed, becauſe they had full inſtructions before this time about the abolition of the Ceremonial Appointments. All S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, in which there are clear expreſſions about this matter, were written before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> If his Doctrine was not preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with them, yet it cannot be imagined, that they ſhould be more ſuperſtitious in this particular than the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were not
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:49823:221"/>converted: and they made no ſcruple before this time, either to fight or fly upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in caſe of danger, as I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated.</p>
               <p>I paſs from the words of Chriſt to his Actions; as his Reſurrection, his appearing after his Reſurrection; the particular Acts done by him at his appearance.</p>
               <p>The old Sabbath being diſcharged, and the Fourth Command ſtill for One in Seven, as is evident by the premiſes, we have a fair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, from the Reſurrection, of our duty to put a peculiar honour upon the Firſt of the Week above all other days, and account it the Chriſtian Sabbath. All days in themſelves are equal, That which alters this equality and advanceth one day above another, is the eminence of the work which is done upon it. The Reſurrection of Chriſt being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the new Creation and of our redemption from the direful effects of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Apoſtaſie, is the moſt eminent perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance the World has been acquainted with. Were we left to our own conduct, what day could we make choice of to be the day of our Solemn Worſhip, and reſt from thoſe labours which are not reconcileable with it,<note place="margin">Euſeb. de laud.

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:49823:222"/>than the people from the ſhoulders upwards. The Firſt of the Week being advanced by the Reſurrection, and made much taller than any other of the Seven, we may truly ſay, Behold the Day which the Lord hath choſen to be the Queen of Days, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſtiles it.</p>
               <p>As the riſing of Chriſt from the dead upon the Firſt of the Week, promotes our belief, that it is the day which God has appointed in the room of the old Sabbath. So likewiſe his appearing upon it after the Reſurrection, no leſs than five times upon the ſelf-ſame day, once to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi>

Eight days after taken incluſively, he appeared again, when the Diſciples were met, which was punctually upon the Firſt of the Week. This day was ſingled out by him for the firſt and laſt moſt eminent manifeſtation of himſelf by his Spirit. The firſt to the Diſciples at Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, when the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon them in cloven Tongues.<note place="margin">

For what end were all theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, but to inform future ages, That the Firſt of the Week is a day moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, and to aſſure them of his ſpecial preſence when they convene upon it for his ſolemn Worſhip? To all this I might add, the particular acts which he did at his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He inveſted his Diſciples with power to exerciſe the Miniſterial function, imployed <hi>Peter</hi> to Preach, and by his Sermon at the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:49823:222"/>Third Hour converted Three thouſand, at the Ninth hour Five Thouſand. He held the Angels of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches in his right hand, and out of his mouth went a two-edged ſword, the Sword of the Spirit, namely, the Word of God. All this is very agreeable to the nature of a day wholly devoted to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Holy Apoſtles and Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Upon the Firſt of the Week, when the Diſciples came together to break Bread, <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7.</p>
               <p>Here are actions very ſuitable to the deſign of a Sabbath, Preaching and Adminiſtring the Holy Sacrament. The Time when theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were performed, is the Firſt of the Week, This was a conſtant cuſtom, we never read that the Apoſtle in any place, where he found none but Diſciples, did upon the old Sabbath, communicate with them in thoſe Ordinances, which the Goſpel has appointed.</p>
               <p>Now as touching a <hi>Collection for the Saints, as I have given order to the Churches of</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, <hi>ſo do ye. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the firſt of the week, let every one of you lay up by him in ſtore,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2.</p>
               <p>The duty here enjoyned, is a Collection for the Saints. The Apoſtle did deſign, That it ſhould be very liberal, according to the eſtate of every Man. Why he ſhould wave the ſecond, third, fourth, fifth day of the Week, and pitch upon the Firſt, for the doing of this generous and pious Work, cannot be conceived; except upon the Firſt of the Week
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:49823:223"/>the Diſciples of Chriſt uſe to meet and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſuch Religious performances, as have a tendency to excite the mind to Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.

The heavenly reſt in the world to come, the reſt of the old Sabbath, reſt in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Apoſtle makes it manifeſt, that it is none of theſe which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> means, but the reſt of a Sabbath under the Goſpel. Not the heavenly; for the reſt here ſpoken is confined to a certain day, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Whereas the reſt above is every day without interruption. Not the reſt of the old Sabbath; for that was at the beginning, when the works were finiſhed, from the Creation of the World.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This day God was pleaſed to ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize by a communication of the Holy Ghoſt in ſome extraordinary meaſures: S. <hi>John</hi> was in the Spirit upon it. In the words there is an alluſion to the manner of ſpeaking amongſt
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:49823:224"/>the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who ſay that a man beſides the Soul which he is ordinarily endued with, has another Spirit given to him upon the Sabbath, which they ſtile <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> Such alluſions we have in the very Context. The Seven Spirits, <hi>v.</hi> 4. have a plain aſpect upon the Seven Angels, which, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, do conſtantly attend the throne of God. And the Governours of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches are called Angels, with reſpect to the Rulers in the Synagogues, which were known by that name.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The teſtimony of the following ages. He who conſults the Writings, which are extant, will meet with theſe four Things, which being laid together, will amount to what has been aſſerted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Firſt of the Week was owned by Chriſtians as a Day of Worſhip. 2. As a Sabbath day. 3. As a Day preferred before the old Sabbath. 4. As a Day inſtituted by Chriſt in the place of the old Day.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is manifeſt from <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi>

                  </note> That it was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by all Chriſtians diſperſed throughout the World.</p>
               <p>If it had not been univerſally obſerved, no account can be given why the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who did keep <hi>Saturday</hi> in a conformity to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould celebrate the Lord's day, That they might be agreeable in their practice to
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:49823:225"/>the Chriſtians: and why the conteſt grew ſo high about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> whether it ſhould be upon the Lord's day. There had been no ground for this diſpute, in caſe the Firſt of the Week had not then been honoured above all other days. If this day was ſo generally devoted to Religion, then there was a ceſſation upon it from all thoſe ſecular imployments, which are not reconcileable with ſo ſacred a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: and ſuch a ceſſation is an ingredient eſſential to the conſtitution of a Sabbath.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We find ſometimes the Firſt of the Week to be expreſly called a Sabbath-day, as appears by the words of <hi>Gregory Nyſſen.</hi> He ſtiles it <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Rythmes concerning a <hi>Jew</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, make it manifeſt, That this name was familiarly applyed to the Firſt of the Week. The <hi>Jews</hi> words to thoſe
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:49823:225"/>who offered him their help to pull him off the Jakes upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> were,

               <l>That from this dung I will not riſe.</l>
               <p>The Chriſtians did reply, the Lord's day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next,
<q>Sabbata noſtra quidem, Solomon, celebrabis ibidem.</q>

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is repreſented as a day much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by Chriſtians, before the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. It had ſo much the pre-eminence, That the Laſt of the Week by Spectators out of the Church, and the better and ſounder part of thoſe within, had little or no notice taken of it, or deference paid to it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> obſerving the ſingular regard the Chriſtians had for the Firſt of the Week, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the fixed or ſtated time for Chriſtian Worſhip, is no other but the Lord's day.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Pliny</hi> attempts to repreſent the crimes, which the Chriſtians were guilty of, he ſets this in the front, <hi>Quod ſoliti eſſent ſtato die ante lucem convenire, carmenque Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto tanquam Deo dicere,</hi> That they were wont to meet upon a certain day, and to ſing a Hymn unto Chriſt, as unto God. If it had been uſual for them to meet upon the old Sabbath, as well as the Lord's day; <hi>Pliny</hi> who made it his buſineſs to inquire into their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice would have diſcovered it: and then it would have been, <hi>ſtatis diebus,</hi> not <hi>ſtato die.</hi> Here is only mention of one particular day.

                  <note place="margin">Ad Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> who lived in the time of <hi>Trajan,</hi> to whom <hi>Pliny</hi> wrote.

The celebration of <hi>Sunday</hi> was ſo conſtant amongſt the Chriſtians, that the Heathens
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:49823:226"/>conceived, That they gave ſome veneration to the Sun. Which miſapprehenſion occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the words of <hi>Tertullian, Diem Solis laeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae indulgemus, aliâ longè ratione,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ignatius</hi> calls the Firſt of the Week the Queen of days, and if it was the Queen, it had a Sovereignty over all other days, and would not permit the old Sabbath to ſit in the ſame Throne with it,
<q>Non benè conveniunt, nec in unâ ſede morantur Majeſtas &amp; Amor.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> aſſerts, That the old Sabbath is of no uſe after the time of Chriſt: Whereas when he ſpeaks of the Lord's day, he ſays, That all Chriſtians meet upon it, hear the Prophets read, have a word of Exhortation ſpoken to them: and the whole performance is concluded with Prayer, and a collection for thoſe who are in diſtreſs. Theſe duties uſe to be diſcharged in the Synagogues upon the Old Sabbath, but that being abrogated, they are now tranſlated to the New. The Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> declares, That Chriſtians ought not to reſt on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, but work, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Lord's day before it.

               <p>Laſtly, The Firſt of the Week is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a day inſtituted by Chriſt in the place of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath. For this we have the plain words of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>

                  </gap>, The Lord hath tranſlated the day of the Sabbath to the Lord's day.</p>
               <p>In the Homily of the Place and Time of Prayer, Sunday is Three times called the Sabbath, and it is plainly aſſerted, That there is both the Example and Commandment of God for the celebration of this day: That this Example and Commandment the godly Chriſtians began to follow immediately after the Aſcenſion of our Lord Chriſt; That we are bound to keep the ſame day not only for that it is God's expreſs Commandment, but alſo to declare our ſelves to be loving chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in following the example of our gracious Lord and Father.</p>
               <p>And now if we look back, and conſider, what has been repreſented from the Law, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, our Bleſſed Lord, the Holy Apoſtles, the Chriſtians which lived in the following Ages, we may find juſt reaſon to believe, That when the Old Sabbath was abrogated, the Firſt of the Week was ſubſtituted in the room of it.</p>
